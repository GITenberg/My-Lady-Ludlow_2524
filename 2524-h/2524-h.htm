<h1>MY LADY LUDLOW<br />
by Elizabeth Gaskell</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>I am an old woman now, and things are very different to what they
were in my youth.&nbsp; Then we, who travelled, travelled in coaches,
carrying six inside, and making a two days&rsquo; journey out of what
people now go over in a couple of hours with a whizz and a flash, and
a screaming whistle, enough to deafen one.&nbsp; Then letters came in
but three times a week: indeed, in some places in Scotland where I have
stayed when I was a girl, the post came in but once a month;&mdash;but
letters were letters then; and we made great prizes of them, and read
them and studied them like books.&nbsp; Now the post comes rattling
in twice a day, bringing short jerky notes, some without beginning or
end, but just a little sharp sentence, which well-bred folks would think
too abrupt to be spoken.&nbsp; Well, well! they may all be improvements,&mdash;I
dare say they are; but you will never meet with a Lady Ludlow in these
days.</p>
<p>I will try and tell you about her.&nbsp; It is no story: it has,
as I said, neither beginning, middle, nor end.</p>
<p>My father was a poor clergyman with a large family.&nbsp; My mother
was always said to have good blood in her veins; and when she wanted
to maintain her position with the people she was thrown among,&mdash;principally
rich democratic manufacturers, all for liberty and the French Revolution,&mdash;she
would put on a pair of ruffles, trimmed with real old English point,
very much darned to be sure,&mdash;but which could not be bought new
for love or money, as the art of making it was lost years before.&nbsp;
These ruffles showed, as she said, that her ancestors had been Somebodies,
when the grandfathers of the rich folk, who now looked down upon her,
had been Nobodies,&mdash;if, indeed, they had any grandfathers at all.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know whether any one out of our own family ever noticed
these ruffles,&mdash;but we were all taught as children to feel rather
proud when my mother put them on, and to hold up our heads as became
the descendants of the lady who had first possessed the lace.&nbsp;
Not but what my dear father often told us that pride was a great sin;
we were never allowed to be proud of anything but my mother&rsquo;s
ruffles: and she was so innocently happy when she put them on,&mdash;often,
poor dear creature, to a very worn and threadbare gown,&mdash;that I
still think, even after all my experience of life, they were a blessing
to the family.&nbsp; You will think that I am wandering away from my
Lady Ludlow.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; The Lady who had owned the lace,
Ursula Hanbury, was a common ancestress of both my mother and my Lady
Ludlow.&nbsp; And so it fell out, that when my poor father died, and
my mother was sorely pressed to know what to do with her nine children,
and looked far and wide for signs of willingness to help, Lady Ludlow
sent her a letter, proffering aid and assistance.&nbsp; I see that letter
now: a large sheet of thick yellow paper, with a straight broad margin
left on the left-hand side of the delicate Italian writing,&mdash;writing
which contained far more in the same space of paper than all the sloping,
or masculine hand-writings of the present day.&nbsp; It was sealed with
a coat of arms,&mdash;a lozenge,&mdash;for Lady Ludlow was a widow.&nbsp;
My mother made us notice the motto, &ldquo;Foy et Loy,&rdquo; and told
us where to look for the quarterings of the Hanbury arms before she
opened the letter.&nbsp; Indeed, I think she was rather afraid of what
the contents might be; for, as I have said, in her anxious love for
her fatherless children, she had written to many people upon whom, to
tell truly, she had but little claim; and their cold, hard answers had
many a time made her cry, when she thought none of us were looking.&nbsp;
I do not even know if she had ever seen Lady Ludlow: all I knew of her
was that she was a very grand lady, whose grandmother had been half-sister
to my mother&rsquo;s great-grandmother; but of her character and circumstances
I had heard nothing, and I doubt if my mother was acquainted with them.</p>
<p>I looked over my mother&rsquo;s shoulder to read the letter; it began,
&ldquo;Dear Cousin Margaret Dawson,&rdquo; and I think I felt hopeful
from the moment I saw those words.&nbsp; She went on to say,&mdash;stay,
I think I can remember the very words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;DEAR COUSIN MARGARET DAWSON,&mdash;I have been much grieved
to hear of the loss you have sustained in the death of so good a husband,
and so excellent a clergyman as I have always heard that my late cousin
Richard was esteemed to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said my mother, laying her finger on the passage,
&ldquo;read that aloud to the little ones.&nbsp; Let them hear how their
father&rsquo;s good report travelled far and wide, and how well he is
spoken of by one whom he never saw.&nbsp; COUSIN Richard, how prettily
her ladyship writes!&nbsp; Go on, Margaret!&rdquo;&nbsp; She wiped her
eyes as she spoke: and laid her fingers on her lips, to still my little
sister, Cecily, who, not understanding anything about the important
letter, was beginning to talk and make a noise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say you are left with nine children.&nbsp; I too should
have had nine, if mine had all lived.&nbsp; I have none left but Rudolph,
the present Lord Ludlow.&nbsp; He is married, and lives, for the most
part, in London.&nbsp; But I entertain six young gentlewomen at my house
at Connington, who are to me as daughters&mdash;save that, perhaps,
I restrict them in certain indulgences in dress and diet that might
be befitting in young ladies of a higher rank, and of more probable
wealth.&nbsp; These young persons&mdash;all of condition, though out
of means&mdash;are my constant companions, and I strive to do my duty
as a Christian lady towards them.&nbsp; One of these young gentlewomen
died (at her own home, whither she had gone upon a visit) last May.&nbsp;
Will you do me the favour to allow your eldest daughter to supply her
place in my household?&nbsp; She is, as I make out, about sixteen years
of age.&nbsp; She will find companions here who are but a little older
than herself.&nbsp; I dress my young friends myself, and make each of
them a small allowance for pocket-money.&nbsp; They have but few opportunities
for matrimony, as Connington is far removed from any town.&nbsp; The
clergyman is a deaf old widower; my agent is married; and as for the
neighbouring farmers, they are, of course, below the notice of the young
gentlewomen under my protection.&nbsp; Still, if any young woman wishes
to marry, and has conducted herself to my satisfaction, I give her a
wedding dinner, her clothes, and her house-linen.&nbsp; And such as
remain with me to my death, will find a small competency provided for
them in my will.&nbsp; I reserve to myself the option of paying their
travelling expenses,&mdash;disliking gadding women, on the one hand;
on the other, not wishing by too long absence from the family home to
weaken natural ties.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If my proposal pleases you and your daughter&mdash;or rather,
if it pleases you, for I trust your daughter has been too well brought
up to have a will in opposition to yours&mdash;let me know, dear cousin
Margaret Dawson, and I will make arrangements for meeting the young
gentlewoman at Cavistock, which is the nearest point to which the coach
will bring her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My mother dropped the letter, and sat silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not know what to do without you, Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment before, like a young untried girl as I was, I had been pleased
at the notion of seeing a new place, and leading a new life.&nbsp; But
now,&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s look of sorrow, and the children&rsquo;s
cry of remonstrance: &ldquo;Mother; I won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay! but you had better,&rdquo; replied she, shaking her head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady Ludlow has much power.&nbsp; She can help your brothers.&nbsp;
It will not do to slight her offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we accepted it, after much consultation.&nbsp; We were rewarded,&mdash;or
so we thought,&mdash;for, afterwards, when I came to know Lady Ludlow,
I saw that she would have done her duty by us, as helpless relations,
however we might have rejected her kindness,&mdash;by a presentation
to Christ&rsquo;s Hospital for one of my brothers.</p>
<p>And this was how I came to know my Lady Ludlow.</p>
<p>I remember well the afternoon of my arrival at Hanbury Court.&nbsp;
Her ladyship had sent to meet me at the nearest post-town at which the
mail-coach stopped.&nbsp; There was an old groom inquiring for me, the
ostler said, if my name was Dawson&mdash;from Hanbury Court, he believed.&nbsp;
I felt it rather formidable; and first began to understand what was
meant by going among strangers, when I lost sight of the guard to whom
my mother had intrusted me.&nbsp; I was perched up in a high gig with
a hood to it, such as in those days was called a chair, and my companion
was driving deliberately through the most pastoral country I had ever
yet seen.&nbsp; By-and-by we ascended a long hill, and the man got out
and walked at the horse&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; I should have liked to walk,
too, very much indeed; but I did not know how far I might do it; and,
in fact, I dared not speak to ask to be helped down the deep steps of
the gig.&nbsp; We were at last at the top,&mdash;on a long, breezy,
sweeping, unenclosed piece of ground, called, as I afterwards learnt,
a Chase.&nbsp; The groom stopped, breathed, patted his horse, and then
mounted again to my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we near Hanbury Court?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near!&nbsp; Why, Miss! we&rsquo;ve a matter of ten mile yet
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once launched into conversation, we went on pretty glibly.&nbsp;
I fancy he had been afraid of beginning to speak to me, just as I was
to him; but he got over his shyness with me sooner than I did mine with
him.&nbsp; I let him choose the subjects of conversation, although very
often I could not understand the points of interest in them: for instance,
he talked for more than a quarter of an hour of a famous race which
a certain dog-fox had given him, above thirty years before; and spoke
of all the covers and turns just as if I knew them as well as he did;
and all the time I was wondering what kind of an animal a dog-fox might
be.</p>
<p>After we lost the Chase, the road grew worse.&nbsp; No one in these
days, who has not seen the byroads of fifty years ago, can imagine what
they were.&nbsp; We had to quarter, as Randal called it, nearly all
the way along the deep-rutted, miry lanes; and the tremendous jolts
I occasionally met with made my seat in the gig so unsteady that I could
not look about me at all, I was so much occupied in holding on.&nbsp;
The road was too muddy for me to walk without dirtying myself more than
I liked to do, just before my first sight of my Lady Ludlow.&nbsp; But
by-and-by, when we came to the fields in which the lane ended, I begged
Randal to help me down, as I saw that I could pick my steps among the
pasture grass without making myself unfit to be seen; and Randal, out
of pity for his steaming horse, wearied with the hard struggle through
the mud, thanked me kindly, and helped me down with a springing jump.</p>
<p>The pastures fell gradually down to the lower land, shut in on either
side by rows of high elms, as if there had been a wide grand avenue
here in former times.&nbsp; Down the grassy gorge we went, seeing the
sunset sky at the end of the shadowed descent.&nbsp; Suddenly we came
to a long flight of steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll run down there, Miss, I&rsquo;ll go round
and meet you, and then you&rsquo;d better mount again, for my lady will
like to see you drive up to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we near the house?&rdquo; said I, suddenly checked by
the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down there, Miss,&rdquo; replied he, pointing with his whip
to certain stacks of twisted chimneys rising out of a group of trees,
in deep shadow against the crimson light, and which lay just beyond
a great square lawn at the base of the steep slope of a hundred yards,
on the edge of which we stood.</p>
<p>I went down the steps quietly enough.&nbsp; I met Randal and the
gig at the bottom; and, falling into a side road to the left, we drove
sedately round, through the gateway, and into the great court in front
of the house.</p>
<p>The road by which we had come lay right at the back.</p>
<p>Hanbury Court is a vast red-brick house&mdash;at least, it is cased
in part with red bricks; and the gate-house and walls about the place
are of brick,&mdash;with stone facings at every corner, and door, and
window, such as you see at Hampton Court.&nbsp; At the back are the
gables, and arched doorways, and stone mullions, which show (so Lady
Ludlow used to tell us) that it was once a priory.&nbsp; There was a
prior&rsquo;s parlour, I know&mdash;only we called it Mrs. Medlicott&rsquo;s
room; and there was a tithe-barn as big as a church, and rows of fish-ponds,
all got ready for the monks&rsquo; fasting-days in old time.&nbsp; But
all this I did not see till afterwards.&nbsp; I hardly noticed, this
first night, the great Virginian Creeper (said to have been the first
planted in England by one of my lady&rsquo;s ancestors) that half covered
the front of the house.&nbsp; As I had been unwilling to leave the guard
of the coach, so did I now feel unwilling to leave Randal, a known friend
of three hours.&nbsp; But there was no help for it; in I must go; past
the grand-looking old gentleman holding the door open for me, on into
the great hall on the right hand, into which the sun&rsquo;s last rays
were sending in glorious red light,&mdash;the gentleman was now walking
before me,&mdash;up a step on to the dais, as I afterwards learned that
it was called,&mdash;then again to the left, through a series of sitting-rooms,
opening one out of another, and all of them looking into a stately garden,
glowing, even in the twilight, with the bloom of flowers.&nbsp; We went
up four steps out of the last of these rooms, and then my guide lifted
up a heavy silk curtain and I was in the presence of my Lady Ludlow.</p>
<p>She was very small of stature, and very upright.&nbsp; She wore a
great lace cap, nearly half her own height, I should think, that went
round her head (caps which tied under the chin, and which we called
&ldquo;mobs,&rdquo; came in later, and my lady held them in great contempt,
saying people might as well come down in their nightcaps).&nbsp; In
front of my lady&rsquo;s cap was a great bow of white satin ribbon;
and a broad band of the same ribbon was tied tight round her head, and
served to keep the cap straight.&nbsp; She had a fine Indian muslin
shawl folded over her shoulders and across her chest, and an apron of
the same; a black silk mode gown, made with short sleeves and ruffles,
and with the tail thereof pulled through the pocket-hole, so as to shorten
it to a useful length: beneath it she wore, as I could plainly see,
a quilted lavender satin petticoat.&nbsp; Her hair was snowy white,
but I hardly saw it, it was so covered with her cap: her skin, even
at her age, was waxen in texture and tint; her eyes were large and dark
blue, and must have been her great beauty when she was young, for there
was nothing particular, as far as I can remember, either in mouth or
nose.&nbsp; She had a great gold-headed stick by her chair; but I think
it was more as a mark of state and dignity than for use; for she had
as light and brisk a step when she chose as any girl of fifteen, and,
in her private early walk of meditation in the mornings, would go as
swiftly from garden alley to garden alley as any one of us.</p>
<p>She was standing up when I went in.&nbsp; I dropped my curtsey at
the door, which my mother had always taught me as a part of good manners,
and went up instinctively to my lady.&nbsp; She did not put out her
hand, but raised herself a little on tiptoe, and kissed me on both cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are cold, my child.&nbsp; You shall have a dish of tea
with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She rang a little hand-bell on the table by her,
and her waiting-maid came in from a small anteroom; and, as if all had
been prepared, and was awaiting my arrival, brought with her a small
china service with tea ready made, and a plate of delicately-cut bread
and butter, every morsel of which I could have eaten, and been none
the better for it, so hungry was I after my long ride.&nbsp; The waiting-maid
took off my cloak, and I sat down, sorely alarmed at the silence, the
hushed foot-falls of the subdued maiden over the thick carpet, and the
soft voice and clear pronunciation of my Lady Ludlow.&nbsp; My teaspoon
fell against my cup with a sharp noise, that seemed so out of place
and season that I blushed deeply.&nbsp; My lady caught my eye with hers,&mdash;both
keen and sweet were those dark-blue eyes of her ladyship&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hands are very cold, my dear; take off those gloves&rdquo;
(I wore thick serviceable doeskin, and had been too shy to take them
off unbidden), &ldquo;and let me try and warm them&mdash;the evenings
are very chilly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she held my great red hands in hers,&mdash;soft,
warm, white, ring-laden.&nbsp; Looking at last a little wistfully into
my face, she said&mdash;&ldquo;Poor child!&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re the
eldest of nine!&nbsp; I had a daughter who would have been just your
age; but I cannot fancy her the eldest of nine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came
a pause of silence; and then she rang her bell, and desired her waiting-maid,
Adams, to show me to my room.</p>
<p>It was so small that I think it must have been a cell.&nbsp; The
walls were whitewashed stone; the bed was of white dimity.&nbsp; There
was a small piece of red staircarpet on each side of the bed, and two
chairs.&nbsp; In a closet adjoining were my washstand and toilet-table.&nbsp;
There was a text of Scripture painted on the wall right opposite to
my bed; and below hung a print, common enough in those days, of King
George and Queen Charlotte, with all their numerous children, down to
the little Princess Amelia in a go-cart.&nbsp; On each side hung a small
portrait, also engraved: on the left, it was Louis the Sixteenth; on
the other, Marie-Antoinette.&nbsp; On the chimney-piece there was a
tinder-box and a Prayer-book.&nbsp; I do not remember anything else
in the room.&nbsp; Indeed, in those days people did not dream of writing-tables,
and inkstands, and portfolios, and easy chairs, and what not.&nbsp;
We were taught to go into our bedrooms for the purposes of dressing,
and sleeping, and praying.</p>
<p>Presently I was summoned to supper.&nbsp; I followed the young lady
who had been sent to call me, down the wide shallow stairs, into the
great hall, through which I had first passed on my way to my Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; There were four other young gentlewomen, all standing, and
all silent, who curtsied to me when I first came in.&nbsp; They were
dressed in a kind of uniform: muslin caps bound round their heads with
blue ribbons, plain muslin handkerchiefs, lawn aprons, and drab-coloured
stuff gowns.&nbsp; They were all gathered together at a little distance
from the table, on which were placed a couple of cold chickens, a salad,
and a fruit tart.&nbsp; On the dais there was a smaller round table,
on which stood a silver jug filled with milk, and a small roll.&nbsp;
Near that was set a carved chair, with a countess&rsquo;s coronet surmounting
the back of it.&nbsp; I thought that some one might have spoken to me;
but they were shy, and I was shy; or else there was some other reason;
but, indeed, almost the minute after I had come into the hall by the
door at the lower hand, her ladyship entered by the door opening upon
the dais; whereupon we all curtsied very low; I because I saw the others
do it.&nbsp; She stood, and looked at us for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlewomen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;make Margaret Dawson
welcome among you;&rdquo; and they treated me with the kind politeness
due to a stranger, but still without any talking beyond what was required
for the purposes of the meal.&nbsp; After it was over, and grace was
said by one of our party, my lady rang her hand-bell, and the servants
came in and cleared away the supper things: then they brought in a portable
reading-desk, which was placed on the dais, and, the whole household
trooping in, my lady called to one of my companions to come up and read
the Psalms and Lessons for the day.&nbsp; I remember thinking how afraid
I should have been had I been in her place.&nbsp; There were no prayers.&nbsp;
My lady thought it schismatic to have any prayers excepting those in
the Prayer-book; and would as soon have preached a sermon herself in
the parish church, as have allowed any one not a deacon at the least
to read prayers in a private dwelling-house.&nbsp; I am not sure that
even then she would have approved of his reading them in an unconsecrated
place.</p>
<p>She had been maid of honour to Queen Charlotte: a Hanbury of that
old stock that flourished in the days of the Plantagenets, and heiress
of all the land that remained to the family, of the great estates which
had once stretched into four separate counties.&nbsp; Hanbury Court
was hers by right.&nbsp; She had married Lord Ludlow, and had lived
for many years at his various seats, and away from her ancestral home.&nbsp;
She had lost all her children but one, and most of them had died at
these houses of Lord Ludlow&rsquo;s; and, I dare say, that gave my lady
a distaste to the places, and a longing to come back to Hanbury Court,
where she had been so happy as a girl.&nbsp; I imagine her girlhood
had been the happiest time of her life; for, now I think of it, most
of her opinions, when I knew her in later life, were singular enough
then, but had been universally prevalent fifty years before.&nbsp; For
instance, while I lived at Hanbury Court, the cry for education was
beginning to come up: Mr. Raikes had set up his Sunday Schools; and
some clergymen were all for teaching writing and arithmetic, as well
as reading.&nbsp; My lady would have none of this; it was levelling
and revolutionary, she said.&nbsp; When a young woman came to be hired,
my lady would have her in, and see if she liked her looks and her dress,
and question her about her family.&nbsp; Her ladyship laid great stress
upon this latter point, saying that a girl who did not warm up when
any interest or curiosity was expressed about her mother, or the &ldquo;baby&rdquo;
(if there was one), was not likely to make a good servant.&nbsp; Then
she would make her put out her feet, to see if they were well and neatly
shod.&nbsp; Then she would bid her say the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the
Creed.&nbsp; Then she inquired if she could write.&nbsp; If she could,
and she had liked all that had gone before, her face sank&mdash;it was
a great disappointment, for it was an all but inviolable rule with her
never to engage a servant who could write.&nbsp; But I have known her
ladyship break through it, although in both cases in which she did so
she put the girl&rsquo;s principles to a further and unusual test in
asking her to repeat the Ten Commandments.&nbsp; One pert young woman&mdash;and
yet I was sorry for her too, only she afterwards married a rich draper
in Shrewsbury&mdash;who had got through her trials pretty tolerably,
considering she could write, spoilt all, by saying glibly, at the end
of the last Commandment, &ldquo;An&rsquo;t please your ladyship, I can
cast accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, wench,&rdquo; said my lady in a hurry, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
only fit for trade; you will not suit me for a servant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The girl went away crestfallen: in a minute, however, my lady sent me
after her to see that she had something to eat before leaving the house;
and, indeed, she sent for her once again, but it was only to give her
a Bible, and to bid her beware of French principles, which had led the
French to cut off their king&rsquo;s and queen&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>The poor, blubbering girl said, &ldquo;Indeed, my lady, I wouldn&rsquo;t
hurt a fly, much less a king, and I cannot abide the French, nor frogs
neither, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my lady was inexorable, and took a girl who could neither read
nor write, to make up for her alarm about the progress of education
towards addition and subtraction; and afterwards, when the clergyman
who was at Hanbury parish when I came there, had died, and the bishop
had appointed another, and a younger man, in his stead, this was one
of the points on which he and my lady did not agree.&nbsp; While good
old deaf Mr. Mountford lived, it was my lady&rsquo;s custom, when indisposed
for a sermon, to stand up at the door of her large square pew,&mdash;just
opposite to the reading-desk,&mdash;and to say (at that part of the
morning service where it is decreed that, in quires and places where
they sing, here followeth the anthem): &ldquo;Mr. Mountford, I will
not trouble you for a discourse this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we all
knelt down to the Litany with great satisfaction; for Mr. Mountford,
though he could not hear, had always his eyes open about this part of
the service, for any of my lady&rsquo;s movements.&nbsp; But the new
clergyman, Mr. Gray, was of a different stamp.&nbsp; He was very zealous
in all his parish work; and my lady, who was just as good as she could
be to the poor, was often crying him up as a godsend to the parish,
and he never could send amiss to the Court when he wanted broth, or
wine, or jelly, or sago for a sick person.&nbsp; But he needs must take
up the new hobby of education; and I could see that this put my lady
sadly about one Sunday, when she suspected, I know not how, that there
was something to be said in his sermon about a Sunday-school which he
was planning.&nbsp; She stood up, as she had not done since Mr. Mountford&rsquo;s
death, two years and better before this time, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray, I will not trouble you for a discourse this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her voice was not well-assured and steady; and we knelt down
with more of curiosity than satisfaction in our minds.&nbsp; Mr. Gray
preached a very rousing sermon, on the necessity of establishing a Sabbath-school
in the village.&nbsp; My lady shut her eyes, and seemed to go to sleep;
but I don&rsquo;t believe she lost a word of it, though she said nothing
about it that I heard until the next Saturday, when two of us, as was
the custom, were riding out with her in her carriage, and we went to
see a poor bedridden woman, who lived some miles away at the other end
of the estate and of the parish: and as we came out of the cottage we
met Mr. Gray walking up to it, in a great heat, and looking very tired.&nbsp;
My lady beckoned him to her, and told him she should wait and take him
home with her, adding that she wondered to see him there, so far from
his home, for that it was beyond a Sabbath-day&rsquo;s journey, and,
from what she had gathered from his sermon the last Sunday, he was all
for Judaism against Christianity.&nbsp; He looked as if he did not understand
what she meant; but the truth was that, besides the way in which he
had spoken up for schools and schooling, he had kept calling Sunday
the Sabbath: and, as her ladyship said, &ldquo;The Sabbath is the Sabbath,
and that&rsquo;s one thing&mdash;it is Saturday; and if I keep it, I&rsquo;m
a Jew, which I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; And Sunday is Sunday; and that&rsquo;s
another thing; and if I keep it, I&rsquo;m a Christian, which I humbly
trust I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Mr. Gray got an inkling of her meaning in talking about
a Sabbath-day&rsquo;s journey, he only took notice of a part of it:
he smiled and bowed, and said no one knew better than her ladyship what
were the duties that abrogated all inferior laws regarding the Sabbath;
and that he must go in and read to old Betty Brown, so that he would
not detain her ladyship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall wait for you, Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or I will take a drive round by Oakfield, and be back in an hour&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, you see, she would not have him feel hurried
or troubled with a thought that he was keeping her waiting, while he
ought to be comforting and praying with old Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty young man, my dears,&rdquo; said she, as we
drove away.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I shall have my pew glazed all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did not know what she meant at the time; but the next Sunday but
one we did.&nbsp; She had the curtains all round the grand old Hanbury
family seat taken down, and, instead of them, there was glass up to
the height of six or seven feet.&nbsp; We entered by a door, with a
window in it that drew up or down just like what you see in carriages.&nbsp;
This window was generally down, and then we could hear perfectly; but
if Mr. Gray used the word &ldquo;Sabbath,&rdquo; or spoke in favour
of schooling and education, my lady stepped out of her corner, and drew
up the window with a decided clang and clash.</p>
<p>I must tell you something more about Mr. Gray.&nbsp; The presentation
to the living of Hanbury was vested in two trustees, of whom Lady Ludlow
was one: Lord Ludlow had exercised this right in the appointment of
Mr. Mountford, who had won his lordship&rsquo;s favour by his excellent
horsemanship.&nbsp; Nor was Mr. Mountford a bad clergyman, as clergymen
went in those days.&nbsp; He did not drink, though he liked good eating
as much as any one.&nbsp; And if any poor person was ill, and he heard
of it, he would send them plates from his own dinner of what he himself
liked best; sometimes of dishes which were almost as bad as poison to
sick people.&nbsp; He meant kindly to everybody except dissenters, whom
Lady Ludlow and he united in trying to drive out of the parish; and
among dissenters he particularly abhorred Methodists&mdash;some one
said, because John Wesley had objected to his hunting.&nbsp; But that
must have been long ago for when I knew him he was far too stout and
too heavy to hunt; besides, the bishop of the diocese disapproved of
hunting, and had intimated his disapprobation to the clergy.&nbsp; For
my own part, I think a good run would not have come amiss, even in a
moral point of view, to Mr. Mountford.&nbsp; He ate so much, and took
so little exercise, that we young women often heard of his being in
terrible passions with his servants, and the sexton and clerk.&nbsp;
But they none of them minded him much, for he soon came to himself,
and was sure to make them some present or other&mdash;some said in proportion
to his anger; so that the sexton, who was a bit of a wag (as all sextons
are, I think), said that the vicar&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;The Devil
take you,&rdquo; was worth a shilling any day, whereas &ldquo;The Deuce&rdquo;
was a shabby sixpenny speech, only fit for a curate.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of good in Mr. Mountford, too.&nbsp; He could
not bear to see pain, or sorrow, or misery of any kind; and, if it came
under his notice, he was never easy till he had relieved it, for the
time, at any rate.&nbsp; But he was afraid of being made uncomfortable;
so, if he possibly could, he would avoid seeing any one who was ill
or unhappy; and he did not thank any one for telling him about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would your ladyship have me to do?&rdquo; he once said
to my Lady Ludlow, when she wished him to go and see a poor man who
had broken his leg.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot piece the leg as the doctor
can; I cannot nurse him as well as his wife does; I may talk to him,
but he no more understands me than I do the language of the alchemists.&nbsp;
My coming puts him out; he stiffens himself into an uncomfortable posture,
out of respect to the cloth, and dare not take the comfort of kicking,
and swearing, and scolding his wife, while I am there.&nbsp; I hear
him, with my figurative ears, my lady, heave a sigh of relief when my
back is turned, and the sermon that he thinks I ought to have kept for
the pulpit, and have delivered to his neighbours (whose case, as he
fancies, it would just have fitted, as it seemed to him to be addressed
to the sinful), is all ended, and done, for the day.&nbsp; I judge others
as myself; I do to them as I would be done to.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Christianity,
at any rate.&nbsp; I should hate&mdash;saving your ladyship&rsquo;s
presence&mdash;to have my Lord Ludlow coming and seeing me, if I were
ill.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be a great honour, no doubt; but I should have
to put on a clean nightcap for the occasion; and sham patience, in order
to be polite, and not weary his lordship with my complaints.&nbsp; I
should be twice as thankful to him if he would send me game, or a good
fat haunch, to bring me up to that pitch of health and strength one
ought to be in, to appreciate the honour of a visit from a nobleman.&nbsp;
So I shall send Jerry Butler a good dinner every day till he is strong
again; and spare the poor old fellow my presence and advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady would be puzzled by this, and by many other of Mr. Mountford&rsquo;s
speeches.&nbsp; But he had been appointed by my lord, and she could
not question her dead husband&rsquo;s wisdom; and she knew that the
dinners were always sent, and often a guinea or two to help to pay the
doctor&rsquo;s bills; and Mr. Mountford was true blue, as we call it,
to the back-bone; hated the dissenters and the French; and could hardly
drink a dish of tea without giving out the toast of &ldquo;Church and
King, and down with the Rump.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, he had once had
the honour of preaching before the King and Queen, and two of the Princesses,
at Weymouth; and the King had applauded his sermon audibly with,&mdash;&ldquo;Very
good; very good;&rdquo; and that was a seal put upon his merit in my
lady&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Besides, in the long winter Sunday evenings, he would come up to
the Court, and read a sermon to us girls, and play a game of picquet
with my lady afterwards; which served to shorten the tedium of the time.&nbsp;
My lady would, on those occasions, invite him to sup with her on the
dais; but as her meal was invariably bread and milk only, Mr. Mountford
preferred sitting down amongst us, and made a joke about its being wicked
and heterodox to eat meagre on Sunday, a festival of the Church.&nbsp;
We smiled at this joke just as much the twentieth time we heard it as
we did at the first; for we knew it was coming, because he always coughed
a little nervously before he made a joke, for fear my lady should not
approve: and neither she nor he seemed to remember that he had ever
hit upon the idea before.</p>
<p>Mr. Mountford died quite suddenly at last.&nbsp; We were all very
sorry to lose him.&nbsp; He left some of his property (for he had a
private estate) to the poor of the parish, to furnish them with an annual
Christmas dinner of roast beef and plum pudding, for which he wrote
out a very good receipt in the codicil to his will.</p>
<p>Moreover, he desired his executors to see that the vault, in which
the vicars of Hanbury were interred, was well aired, before his coffin
was taken in; for, all his life long, he had had a dread of damp, and
latterly he kept his rooms to such a pitch of warmth that some thought
it hastened his end.</p>
<p>Then the other trustee, as I have said, presented the living to Mr.
Gray, Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford.&nbsp; It was quite natural
for us all, as belonging in some sort to the Hanbury family, to disapprove
of the other trustee&rsquo;s choice.&nbsp; But when some ill-natured
person circulated the report that Mr. Gray was a Moravian Methodist,
I remember my lady said, &ldquo;She could not believe anything so bad,
without a great deal of evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>Before I tell you about Mr. Gray, I think I ought to make you understand
something more of what we did all day long at Hanbury Court.&nbsp; There
were five of us at the time of which I am speaking, all young women
of good descent, and allied (however distantly) to people of rank.&nbsp;
When we were not with my lady, Mrs. Medlicott looked after us; a gentle
little woman, who had been companion to my lady for many years, and
was indeed, I have been told, some kind of relation to her.&nbsp; Mrs.
Medlicott&rsquo;s parents had lived in Germany, and the consequence
was, she spoke English with a very foreign accent.&nbsp; Another consequence
was, that she excelled in all manner of needlework, such as is not known
even by name in these days.&nbsp; She could darn either lace, table-linen,
India muslin, or stockings, so that no one could tell where the hole
or rent had been.&nbsp; Though a good Protestant, and never missing
Guy Faux day at church, she was as skilful at fine work as any nun in
a Papist convent.&nbsp; She would take a piece of French cambric, and
by drawing out some threads, and working in others, it became delicate
lace in a very few hours.&nbsp; She did the same by Hollands cloth,
and made coarse strong lace, with which all my lady&rsquo;s napkins
and table-linen were trimmed.&nbsp; We worked under her during a great
part of the day, either in the still-room, or at our sewing in a chamber
that opened out of the great hall.&nbsp; My lady despised every kind
of work that would now be called Fancy-work.&nbsp; She considered that
the use of coloured threads or worsted was only fit to amuse children;
but that grown women ought not to be taken with mere blues and reds,
but to restrict their pleasure in sewing to making small and delicate
stitches.&nbsp; She would speak of the old tapestry in the hall as the
work of her ancestresses, who lived before the Reformation, and were
consequently unacquainted with pure and simple tastes in work, as well
as in religion.&nbsp; Nor would my lady sanction the fashion of the
day, which, at the beginning of this century, made all the fine ladies
take to making shoes.&nbsp; She said that such work was a consequence
of the French Revolution, which had done much to annihilate all distinctions
of rank and class, and hence it was, that she saw young ladies of birth
and breeding handling lasts, and awls, and dirty cobblers&rsquo;-wax,
like shoe&rsquo;-makers&rsquo; daughters.</p>
<p>Very frequently one of us would be summoned to my lady to read aloud
to her, as she sat in her small withdrawing-room, some improving book.&nbsp;
It was generally Mr. Addison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spectator;&rdquo; but one
year, I remember, we had to read &ldquo;Sturm&rsquo;s Reflections&rdquo;
translated from a German book Mrs. Medlicott recommended.&nbsp; Mr.
Sturm told us what to think about for every day in the year; and very
dull it was; but I believe Queen Charlotte had liked the book very much,
and the thought of her royal approbation kept my lady awake during the
reading.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Chapone&rsquo;s Letters&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dr.
Gregory&rsquo;s Advice to Young Ladies&rdquo; composed the rest of our
library for week-day reading.&nbsp; I, for one, was glad to leave my
fine sewing, and even my reading aloud (though this last did keep me
with my dear lady) to go to the still-room and potter about among the
preserves and the medicated waters.&nbsp; There was no doctor for many
miles round, and with Mrs. Medlicott to direct us, and Dr. Buchan to
go by for recipes, we sent out many a bottle of physic, which, I dare
say, was as good as what comes out of the druggist&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp;
At any rate, I do not think we did much harm; for if any of our physics
tasted stronger than usual, Mrs. Medlicott would bid us let it down
with cochineal and water, to make all safe, as she said.&nbsp; So our
bottles of medicine had very little real physic in them at last; but
we were careful in putting labels on them, which looked very mysterious
to those who could not read, and helped the medicine to do its work.&nbsp;
I have sent off many a bottle of salt and water coloured red; and whenever
we had nothing else to do in the still-room, Mrs. Medlicott would set
us to making bread-pills, by way of practice; and, as far as I can say,
they were very efficacious, as before we gave out a box Mrs. Medlicott
always told the patient what symptoms to expect; and I hardly ever inquired
without hearing that they had produced their effect.&nbsp; There was
one old man, who took six pills a-night, of any kind we liked to give
him, to make him sleep; and if, by any chance, his daughter had forgotten
to let us know that he was out of his medicine, he was so restless and
miserable that, as he said, he thought he was like to die.&nbsp; I think
ours was what would be called homoeopathic practice now-a-days.&nbsp;
Then we learnt to make all the cakes and dishes of the season in the
still-room.&nbsp; We had plum-porridge and mince-pies at Christmas,
fritters and pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, furmenty on Mothering Sunday,
violet-cakes in Passion Week, tansy-pudding on Easter Sunday, three-cornered
cakes on Trinity Sunday, and so on through the year: all made from good
old Church receipts, handed down from one of my lady&rsquo;s earliest
Protestant ancestresses.&nbsp; Every one of us passed a portion of the
day with Lady Ludlow; and now and then we rode out with her in her coach
and four.&nbsp; She did not like to go out with a pair of horses, considering
this rather beneath her rank; and, indeed, four horses were very often
needed to pull her heavy coach through the stiff mud.&nbsp; But it was
rather a cumbersome equipage through the narrow Warwickshire lanes;
and I used often to think it was well that countesses were not plentiful,
or else we might have met another lady of quality in another coach and
four, where there would have been no possibility of turning, or passing
each other, and very little chance of backing.&nbsp; Once when the idea
of this danger of meeting another countess in a narrow, deep-rutted
lane was very prominent in my mind I ventured to ask Mrs. Medlicott
what would have to be done on such an occasion; and she told me that
&ldquo;de latest creation must back, for sure,&rdquo; which puzzled
me a good deal at the time, although I understand it now.&nbsp; I began
to find out the use of the &ldquo;Peerage,&rdquo; a book which had seemed
to me rather dull before; but, as I was always a coward in a coach,
I made myself well acquainted with the dates of creation of our three
Warwickshire earls, and was happy to find that Earl Ludlow ranked second,
the oldest earl being a hunting widower, and not likely to drive out
in a carriage.</p>
<p>All this time I have wandered from Mr. Gray.&nbsp; Of course, we
first saw him in church when he read himself in.&nbsp; He was very red-faced,
the kind of redness which goes with light hair and a blushing complexion;
he looked slight and short, and his bright light frizzy hair had hardly
a dash of powder in it.&nbsp; I remember my lady making this observation,
and sighing over it; for, though since the famine in seventeen hundred
and ninety-nine and eighteen hundred there had been a tax on hair-powder,
yet it was reckoned very revolutionary and Jacobin not to wear a good
deal of it.&nbsp; My lady hardly liked the opinions of any man who wore
his own hair; but this she would say was rather a prejudice: only in
her youth none but the mob had gone wigless, and she could not get over
the association of wigs with birth and breeding; a man&rsquo;s own hair
with that class of people who had formed the rioters in seventeen hundred
and eighty, when Lord George Gordon had been one of the bugbears of
my lady&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Her husband and his brothers, she told us,
had been put into breeches, and had their heads shaved on their seventh
birthday, each of them; a handsome little wig of the newest fashion
forming the old Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s invariable birthday present to her
sons as they each arrived at that age; and afterwards, to the day of
their death, they never saw their own hair.&nbsp; To be without powder,
as some underbred people were talking of being now, was in fact to insult
the proprieties of life, by being undressed.&nbsp; It was English sans-culottism.&nbsp;
But Mr. Gray did wear a little powder, enough to save him in my lady&rsquo;s
good opinion; but not enough to make her approve of him decidedly.</p>
<p>The next time I saw him was in the great hall.&nbsp; Mary Mason and
I were going to drive out with my lady in her coach, and when we went
down stairs with our best hats and cloaks on, we found Mr. Gray awaiting
my lady&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; I believe he had paid his respects to
her before, but we had never seen him; and he had declined her invitation
to spend Sunday evening at the Court (as Mr. Mountford used to do pretty
regularly&mdash;and play a game at picquet too&mdash;), which, Mrs.
Medlicott told us, had caused my lady to be not over well pleased with
him.</p>
<p>He blushed redder than ever at the sight of us, as we entered the
hall and dropped him our curtsies.&nbsp; He coughed two or three times,
as if he would have liked to speak to us, if he could but have found
something to say; and every time he coughed he became hotter-looking
than ever.&nbsp; I am ashamed to say, we were nearly laughing at him;
half because we, too, were so shy that we understood what his awkwardness
meant.</p>
<p>My lady came in, with her quick active step&mdash;she always walked
quickly when she did not bethink herself of her cane&mdash;as if she
was sorry to have us kept waiting&mdash;and, as she entered, she gave
us all round one of those graceful sweeping curtsies, of which I think
the art must have died out with her,&mdash;it implied so much courtesy;&mdash;this
time it said, as well as words could do, &ldquo;I am sorry to have kept
you all waiting,&mdash;forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went up to the mantelpiece, near which Mr. Gray had been standing
until her entrance, and curtseying afresh to him, and pretty deeply
this time, because of his cloth, and her being hostess, and he, a new
guest.&nbsp; She asked him if he would not prefer speaking to her in
her own private parlour, and looked as though she would have conducted
him there.&nbsp; But he burst out with his errand, of which he was full
even to choking, and which sent the glistening tears into his large
blue eyes, which stood farther and farther out with his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady, I want to speak to you, and to persuade you to exert
your kind interest with Mr. Lathom&mdash;Justice Lathom, of Hathaway
Manor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Lathom?&rdquo; inquired my lady,&mdash;as Mr. Gray stopped
to take the breath he had lost in his hurry,&mdash;&ldquo;I did not
know he was in the commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is only just appointed; he took the oaths not a month ago,&mdash;more&rsquo;s
the pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand why you should regret it.&nbsp; The Lathoms
have held Hathaway since Edward the First, and Mr. Lathom bears a good
character, although his temper is hasty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady! he has committed Job Gregson for stealing&mdash;a
fault of which he is as innocent as I&mdash;and all the evidence goes
to prove it, now that the case is brought before the Bench; only the
Squires hang so together that they can&rsquo;t be brought to see justice,
and are all for sending Job to gaol, out of compliment to Mr. Lathom,
saying it his first committal, and it won&rsquo;t be civil to tell him
there is no evidence against his man.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake, my
lady, speak to the gentlemen; they will attend to you, while they only
tell me to mind my own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now my lady was always inclined to stand by her order, and the Lathoms
of Hathaway Court were cousins to the Hanbury&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Besides,
it was rather a point of honour in those days to encourage a young magistrate,
by passing a pretty sharp sentence on his first committals; and Job
Gregson was the father of a girl who had been lately turned away from
her place as scullery-maid for sauciness to Mrs. Adams, her ladyship&rsquo;s
own maid; and Mr. Gray had not said a word of the reasons why he believed
the man innocent,&mdash;for he was in such a hurry, I believe he would
have had my lady drive off to the Henley Court-house then and there;&mdash;so
there seemed a good deal against the man, and nothing but Mr. Gray&rsquo;s
bare word for him; and my lady drew herself a little up, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray!&nbsp; I do not see what reason either you or I have
to interfere.&nbsp; Mr. Harry Lathom is a sensible kind of young man,
well capable of ascertaining the truth without our help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But more evidence has come out since,&rdquo; broke in Mr.
Gray.&nbsp; My lady went a little stiffer, and spoke a little more coldly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this additional evidence is before the justices:
men of good family, and of honour and credit, well known in the county.&nbsp;
They naturally feel that the opinion of one of themselves must have
more weight than the words of a man like Job Gregson, who bears a very
indifferent character,&mdash;has been strongly suspected of poaching,
coming from no one knows where, squatting on Hareman&rsquo;s Common&mdash;which,
by the way, is extra-parochial, I believe; consequently you, as a clergyman,
are not responsible for what goes on there; and, although impolitic,
there might be some truth in what the magistrates said, in advising
you to mind your own business,&rdquo;&mdash;said her ladyship, smiling,&mdash;&ldquo;and
they might be tempted to bid me mind mine, if I interfered, Mr. Gray:
might they not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked extremely uncomfortable; half angry.&nbsp; Once or twice
he began to speak, but checked himself, as if his words would not have
been wise or prudent.&nbsp; At last he said&mdash;&ldquo;It may seem
presumptuous in me,&mdash;a stranger of only a few weeks&rsquo; standing&mdash;to
set up my judgment as to men&rsquo;s character against that of residents&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lady Ludlow gave a little bow of acquiescence, which was, I think, involuntary
on her part, and which I don&rsquo;t think he perceived,&mdash;&ldquo;but
I am convinced that the man is innocent of this offence,&mdash;and besides,
the justices themselves allege this ridiculous custom of paying a compliment
to a newly-appointed magistrate as their only reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That unlucky word &ldquo;ridiculous!&rdquo;&nbsp; It undid all the
good his modest beginning had done him with my lady.&nbsp; I knew as
well as words could have told me, that she was affronted at the expression
being used by a man inferior in rank to those whose actions he applied
it to,&mdash;and truly, it was a great want of tact, considering to
whom he was speaking.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow spoke very gently and slowly; she always did so when
she was annoyed; it was a certain sign, the meaning of which we had
all learnt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Mr. Gray, we will drop the subject.&nbsp; It is one
on which we are not likely to agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray&rsquo;s ruddy colour grew purple and then faded away, and
his face became pale.&nbsp; I think both my lady and he had forgotten
our presence; and we were beginning to feel too awkward to wish to remind
them of it.&nbsp; And yet we could not help watching and listening with
the greatest interest.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray drew himself up to his full height, with an unconscious
feeling of dignity.&nbsp; Little as was his stature, and awkward and
embarrassed as he had been only a few minutes before, I remember thinking
he looked almost as grand as my lady when he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship must remember that it may be my duty to speak
to my parishioners on many subjects on which they do not agree with
me.&nbsp; I am not at liberty to be silent, because they differ in opinion
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s great blue eyes dilated with surprise, and&mdash;I
do think&mdash;anger, at being thus spoken to.&nbsp; I am not sure whether
it was very wise in Mr. Gray.&nbsp; He himself looked afraid of the
consequences but as if he was determined to bear them without flinching.&nbsp;
For a minute there was silence.&nbsp; Then my lady replied&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Gray, I respect your plain speaking, although I may wonder whether a
young man of your age and position has any right to assume that he is
a better judge than one with the experience which I have naturally gained
at my time of life, and in the station I hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I, madam, as the clergyman of this parish, am not to shrink
from telling what I believe to be the truth to the poor and lowly, no
more am I to hold my peace in the presence of the rich and titled.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Gray&rsquo;s face showed that he was in that state of excitement
which in a child would have ended in a good fit of crying.&nbsp; He
looked as if he had nerved himself up to doing and saying things, which
he disliked above everything, and which nothing short of serious duty
could have compelled him to do and say.&nbsp; And at such times every
minute circumstance which could add to pain comes vividly before one.&nbsp;
I saw that he became aware of our presence, and that it added to his
discomfiture.</p>
<p>My lady flushed up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you aware, sir,&rdquo; asked
she, &ldquo;that you have gone far astray from the original subject
of conversation?&nbsp; But as you talk of your parish, allow me to remind
you that Hareman&rsquo;s Common is beyond the bounds, and that you are
really not responsible for the characters and lives of the squatters
on that unlucky piece of ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I see I have only done harm in speaking to you about
the affair at all.&nbsp; I beg your pardon and take my leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed, and looked very sad.&nbsp; Lady Ludlow caught the expression
of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; she cried, in rather a louder and quicker
way than that in which she had been speaking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember,
Job Gregson is a notorious poacher and evildoer, and you really are
not responsible for what goes on at Hareman&rsquo;s Common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was near the hall door, and said something&mdash;half to himself,
which we heard (being nearer to him), but my lady did not; although
she saw that he spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she asked
in a somewhat hurried manner, as soon as the door was closed&mdash;&ldquo;I
did not hear.&rdquo;&nbsp; We looked at each other, and then I spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, my lady, that &lsquo;God help him! he was responsible
for all the evil he did not strive to overcome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady turned sharp round away from us, and Mary Mason said afterwards
she thought her ladyship was much vexed with both of us, for having
been present, and with me for having repeated what Mr. Gray had said.&nbsp;
But it was not our fault that we were in the hall, and when my lady
asked what Mr. Gray had said, I thought it right to tell her.</p>
<p>In a few minutes she bade us accompany her in her ride in the coach.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow always sat forwards by herself, and we girls backwards.&nbsp;
Somehow this was a rule, which we never thought of questioning.&nbsp;
It was true that riding backwards made some of us feel very uncomfortable
and faint; and to remedy this my lady always drove with both windows
open, which occasionally gave her the rheumatism; but we always went
on in the old way.&nbsp; This day she did not pay any great attention
to the road by which we were going, and Coachman took his own way.&nbsp;
We were very silent, as my lady did not speak, and looked very serious.&nbsp;
Or else, in general, she made these rides very pleasant (to those who
were not qualmish with riding backwards), by talking to us in a very
agreeable manner, and telling us of the different things which had happened
to her at various places,&mdash;at Paris and Versailles, where she had
been in her youth,&mdash;at Windsor and Kew and Weymouth, where she
had been with the Queen, when maid-of-honour&mdash;and so on.&nbsp;
But this day she did not talk at all.&nbsp; All at once she put her
head out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Footman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;where are we?&nbsp;
Surely this is Hareman&rsquo;s Common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo;t please my lady,&rdquo; said John Footman,
and waited for further speech or orders.&nbsp; My lady thought a while,
and then said she would have the steps put down and get out.</p>
<p>As soon as she was gone, we looked at each other, and then without
a word began to gaze after her.&nbsp; We saw her pick her dainty way
in the little high-heeled shoes she always wore (because they had been
in fashion in her youth), among the yellow pools of stagnant water that
had gathered in the clayey soil.&nbsp; John Footman followed, stately,
after; afraid too, for all his stateliness, of splashing his pure white
stockings.&nbsp; Suddenly my lady turned round and said something to
him, and he returned to the carriage with a half-pleased, half-puzzled
air.</p>
<p>My lady went on to a cluster of rude mud houses at the higher end
of the Common; cottages built, as they were occasionally at that day,
of wattles and clay, and thatched with sods.&nbsp; As far as we could
make out from dumb show, Lady Ludlow saw enough of the interiors of
these places to make her hesitate before entering, or even speaking
to any of the children who were playing about in the puddles.&nbsp;
After a pause, she disappeared into one of the cottages.&nbsp; It seemed
to us a long time before she came out; but I dare say it was not more
than eight or ten minutes.&nbsp; She came back with her head hanging
down, as if to choose her way,&mdash;but we saw it was more in thought
and bewilderment than for any such purpose.</p>
<p>She had not made up her mind where we should drive to when she got
into the carriage again.&nbsp; John Footman stood, bare-headed, waiting
for orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Hathaway.&nbsp; My dears, if you are tired, or if you have
anything to do for Mrs. Medlicott, I can drop you at Barford Corner,
and it is but a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s brisk walk home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But luckily we could safely say that Mrs. Medlicott did not want
us; and as we had whispered to each other, as we sat alone in the coach,
that surely my lady must have gone to Job Gregson&rsquo;s, we were far
too anxious to know the end of it all to say that we were tired.&nbsp;
So we all set off to Hathaway.&nbsp; Mr. Harry Lathom was a bachelor
squire, thirty or thirty-five years of age, more at home in the field
than in the drawing-room, and with sporting men than with ladies.</p>
<p>My lady did not alight, of course; it was Mr. Lathom&rsquo;s place
to wait upon her, and she bade the butler,&mdash;who had a smack of
the gamekeeper in him, very unlike our own powdered venerable fine gentleman
at Hanbury,&mdash;tell his master, with her compliments, that she wished
to speak to him.&nbsp; You may think how pleased we were to find that
we should hear all that was said; though, I think, afterwards we were
half sorry when we saw how our presence confused the squire, who would
have found it bad enough to answer my lady&rsquo;s questions, even without
two eager girls for audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, Mr. Lathom,&rdquo; began my lady, something abruptly
for her,&mdash;but she was very full of her subject,&mdash;&ldquo;what
is this I hear about Job Gregson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lathom looked annoyed and vexed, but dared not show it in his
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave out a warrant against him, my lady, for theft,&mdash;that
is all.&nbsp; You are doubtless aware of his character; a man who sets
nets and springes in long cover, and fishes wherever he takes a fancy.&nbsp;
It is but a short step from poaching to thieving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; replied Lady Ludlow (who had a
horror of poaching for this very reason): &ldquo;but I imagine you do
not send a man to gaol on account of his bad character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogues and vagabonds,&rdquo; said Mr. Lathom.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
man may be sent to prison for being a vagabond; for no specific act,
but for his general mode of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had the better of her ladyship for one moment; but then she answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in this case, the charge on which you committed him is
for theft; now his wife tells me he can prove he was some miles distant
from Holmwood, where the robbery took place, all that afternoon; she
says you had the evidence before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lathom here interrupted my lady, by saying, in a somewhat sulky
manner&mdash;&ldquo;No such evidence was brought before me when I gave
the warrant.&nbsp; I am not answerable for the other magistrates&rsquo;
decision, when they had more evidence before them.&nbsp; It was they
who committed him to gaol.&nbsp; I am not responsible for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady did not often show signs of impatience; but we knew she was
feeling irritated, by the little perpetual tapping of her high-heeled
shoe against the bottom of the carriage.&nbsp; About the same time we,
sitting backwards, caught a glimpse of Mr. Gray through the open door,
standing in the shadow of the hall.&nbsp; Doubtless Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s
arrival had interrupted a conversation between Mr. Lathom and Mr. Gray.&nbsp;
The latter must have heard every word of what she was saying; but of
this she was not aware, and caught at Mr. Lathom&rsquo;s disclaimer
of responsibility with pretty much the same argument which she had heard
(through our repetition) that Mr. Gray had used not two hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to say, Mr. Lathom, that you don&rsquo;t consider
yourself responsible for all injustice or wrong-doing that you might
have prevented, and have not?&nbsp; Nay, in this case the first germ
of injustice was your own mistake.&nbsp; I wish you had been with me
a little while ago, and seen the misery in that poor fellow&rsquo;s
cottage.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke lower, and Mr. Gray drew near, in a
sort of involuntary manner; as if to hear all she was saying.&nbsp;
We saw him, and doubtless Mr. Lathom heard his footstep, and knew who
it was that was listening behind him, and approving of every word that
was said.&nbsp; He grew yet more sullen in manner; but still my lady
was my lady, and he dared not speak out before her, as he would have
done to Mr. Gray.&nbsp; Lady Ludlow, however, caught the look of stubborness
in his face, and it roused her as I had never seen her roused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will not refuse, sir, to accept my bail.&nbsp;
I offer to bail the fellow out, and to be responsible for his appearance
at the sessions.&nbsp; What say you to that, Mr. Lathom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The offence of theft is not bailable, my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in ordinary cases, I dare say.&nbsp; But I imagine this
is an extraordinary case.&nbsp; The man is sent to prison out of compliment
to you, and against all evidence, as far as I can learn.&nbsp; He will
have to rot in gaol for two months, and his wife and children to starve.&nbsp;
I, Lady Ludlow, offer to bail him out, and pledge myself for his appearance
at next quarter-sessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is against the law, my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Bah! Bah!&nbsp; Who makes laws?&nbsp; Such as I, in the
House of Lords&mdash;such as you, in the House of Commons.&nbsp; We,
who make the laws in St. Stephen&rsquo;s, may break the mere forms of
them, when we have right on our sides, on our own land, and amongst
our own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lord-lieutenant may take away my commission, if he heard
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very good thing for the county, Harry Lathom; and for
you too, if he did,&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t go on more wisely than
you have begun.&nbsp; A pretty set you and your brother magistrates
are to administer justice through the land!&nbsp; I always said a good
despotism was the best form of government; and I am twice as much in
favour of it now I see what a quorum is!&nbsp; My dears!&rdquo; suddenly
turning round to us, &ldquo;if it would not tire you to walk home, I
would beg Mr. Lathom to take a seat in my coach, and we would drive
to Henley Gaol, and have the poor man out at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A walk over the fields at this time of day is hardly fitting
for young ladies to take alone,&rdquo; said Mr. Lathom, anxious no doubt
to escape from his t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te drive with my lady,
and possibly not quite prepared to go to the illegal length of prompt
measures, which she had in contemplation.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gray now stepped forward, too anxious for the release of
the prisoner to allow any obstacle to intervene which he could do away
with.&nbsp; To see Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s face when she first perceived
whom she had had for auditor and spectator of her interview with Mr.
Lathom, was as good as a play.&nbsp; She had been doing and saying the
very things she had been so much annoyed at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s saying
and proposing only an hour or two ago.&nbsp; She had been setting down
Mr. Lathom pretty smartly, in the presence of the very man to whom she
had spoken of that gentleman as so sensible, and of such a standing
in the county, that it was presumption to question his doings.&nbsp;
But before Mr. Gray had finished his offer of escorting us back to Hanbury
Court, my lady had recovered herself.&nbsp; There was neither surprise
nor displeasure in her manner, as she answered&mdash;&ldquo;I thank
you, Mr. Gray.&nbsp; I was not aware that you were here, but I think
I can understand on what errand you came.&nbsp; And seeing you here,
recalls me to a duty I owe Mr. Lathom.&nbsp; Mr. Lathom, I have spoken
to you pretty plainly,&mdash;forgetting, until I saw Mr. Gray, that
only this very afternoon I differed from him on this very question;
taking completely, at that time, the same view of the whole subject
which you have done; thinking that the county would be well rid of such
a man as Job Gregson, whether he had committed this theft or not.&nbsp;
Mr. Gray and I did not part quite friends,&rdquo; she continued, bowing
towards him; &ldquo;but it so happened that I saw Job Gregson&rsquo;s
wife and home,&mdash;I felt that Mr. Gray had been right and I had been
wrong, so, with the famous inconsistency of my sex, I came hither to
scold you,&rdquo; smiling towards Mr. Lathom, who looked half-sulky
yet, and did not relax a bit of his gravity at her smile, &ldquo;for
holding the same opinions that I had done an hour before.&nbsp; Mr.
Gray,&rdquo; (again bowing towards him) &ldquo;these young ladies will
be very much obliged to you for your escort, and so shall I.&nbsp; Mr.
Lathom, may I beg of you to accompany me to Henley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray bowed very low, and went very red; Mr. Lathom said something
which we none of us heard, but which was, I think, some remonstrance
against the course he was, as it were, compelled to take.&nbsp; Lady
Ludlow, however, took no notice of his murmur, but sat in an attitude
of polite expectancy; and as we turned off on our walk, I saw Mr. Lathom
getting into the coach with the air of a whipped hound.&nbsp; I must
say, considering my lady&rsquo;s feeling, I did not envy him his ride&mdash;though,
I believe, he was quite in the right as to the object of the ride being
illegal.</p>
<p>Our walk home was very dull.&nbsp; We had no fears; and would far
rather have been without the awkward, blushing young man, into which
Mr. Gray had sunk.&nbsp; At every stile he hesitated,&mdash;sometimes
he half got over it, thinking that he could assist us better in that
way; then he would turn back unwilling to go before ladies.&nbsp; He
had no ease of manner, as my lady once said of him, though on any occasion
of duty, he had an immense deal of dignity.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>As far as I can remember, it was very soon after this that I first
began to have the pain in my hip, which has ended in making me a cripple
for life.&nbsp; I hardly recollect more than one walk after our return
under Mr. Gray&rsquo;s escort from Mr. Lathom&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Indeed,
at the time, I was not without suspicions (which I never named) that
the beginning of all the mischief was a great jump I had taken from
the top of one of the stiles on that very occasion.</p>
<p>Well, it is a long while ago, and God disposes of us all, and I am
not going to tire you out with telling you how I thought and felt, and
how, when I saw what my life was to be, I could hardly bring myself
to be patient, but rather wished to die at once.&nbsp; You can every
one of you think for yourselves what becoming all at once useless and
unable to move, and by-and-by growing hopeless of cure, and feeling
that one must be a burden to some one all one&rsquo;s life long, would
be to an active, wilful, strong girl of seventeen, anxious to get on
in the world, so as, if possible, to help her brothers and sisters.&nbsp;
So I shall only say, that one among the blessings which arose out of
what seemed at the time a great, black sorrow was, that Lady Ludlow
for many years took me, as it were, into her own especial charge; and
now, as I lie still and alone in my old age, it is such a pleasure to
think of her!</p>
<p>Mrs. Medlicott was great as a nurse, and I am sure I can never be
grateful enough to her memory for all her kindness.&nbsp; But she was
puzzled to know how to manage me in other ways.&nbsp; I used to have
long, hard fits of crying; and, thinking that I ought to go home&mdash;and
yet what could they do with me there?&mdash;and a hundred and fifty
other anxious thoughts, some of which I could tell to Mrs. Medlicott,
and others I could not.&nbsp; Her way of comforting me was hurrying
away for some kind of tempting or strengthening food&mdash;a basin of
melted calves-foot jelly was, I am sure she thought, a cure for every
woe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There take it, dear, take it!&rdquo; she would say; &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t go on fretting for what can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, I think, she got puzzled at length at the non-efficacy of good
things to eat; and one day, after I had limped down to see the doctor,
in Mrs. Medlicott&rsquo;s sitting-room&mdash;a room lined with cupboards,
containing preserves and dainties of all kinds, which she perpetually
made, and never touched herself&mdash;when I was returning to my bed-room
to cry away the afternoon, under pretence of arranging my clothes, John
Footman brought me a message from my lady (with whom the doctor had
been having a conversation) to bid me go to her in that private sitting-room
at the end of the suite of apartments, about which I spoke in describing
the day of my first arrival at Hanbury.&nbsp; I had hardly been in it
since; as, when we read to my lady, she generally sat in the small withdrawing-room
out of which this private room of hers opened.&nbsp; I suppose great
people do not require what we smaller people value so much,&mdash;I
mean privacy.&nbsp; I do not think that there was a room which my lady
occupied that had not two doors, and some of them had three or four.&nbsp;
Then my lady had always Adams waiting upon her in her bed-chamber; and
it was Mrs. Medlicott&rsquo;s duty to sit within call, as it were, in
a sort of anteroom that led out of my lady&rsquo;s own sitting-room,
on the opposite side to the drawing-room door.&nbsp; To fancy the house,
you must take a great square and halve it by a line: at one end of this
line was the hall-door, or public entrance; at the opposite the private
entrance from a terrace, which was terminated at one end by a sort of
postern door in an old gray stone wall, beyond which lay the farm buildings
and offices; so that people could come in this way to my lady on business,
while, if she were going into the garden from her own room, she had
nothing to do but to pass through Mrs. Medlicott&rsquo;s apartment,
out into the lesser hall, and then turning to the right as she passed
on to the terrace, she could go down the flight of broad, shallow steps
at the corner of the house into the lovely garden, with stretching,
sweeping lawns, and gay flower-beds, and beautiful, bossy laurels, and
other blooming or massy shrubs, with full-grown beeches, or larches
feathering down to the ground a little farther off.&nbsp; The whole
was set in a frame, as it were, by the more distant woodlands.&nbsp;
The house had been modernized in the days of Queen Anne, I think; but
the money had fallen short that was requisite to carry out all the improvements,
so it was only the suite of withdrawing-rooms and the terrace-rooms,
as far as the private entrance, that had the new, long, high windows
put in, and these were old enough by this time to be draped with roses,
and honeysuckles, and pyracanthus, winter and summer long.</p>
<p>Well, to go back to that day when I limped into my lady&rsquo;s sitting-room,
trying hard to look as if I had not been crying, and not to walk as
if I was in much pain.&nbsp; I do not know whether my lady saw how near
my tears were to my eyes, but she told me she had sent for me, because
she wanted some help in arranging the drawers of her bureau, and asked
me&mdash;just as if it was a favour I was to do her&mdash;if I could
sit down in the easy-chair near the window&mdash;(all quietly arranged
before I came in, with a footstool, and a table quite near)&mdash;and
assist her.&nbsp; You will wonder, perhaps, why I was not bidden to
sit or lie on the sofa; but (although I found one there a morning or
two afterwards, when I came down) the fact was, that there was none
in the room at this time.&nbsp; I have even fancied that the easy-chair
was brought in on purpose for me; for it was not the chair in which
I remembered my lady sitting the first time I saw her.&nbsp; That chair
was very much carved and gilded, with a countess&rsquo; coronet at the
top.&nbsp; I tried it one day, some time afterwards, when my lady was
out of the room, and I had a fancy for seeing how I could move about,
and very uncomfortable it was.&nbsp; Now my chair (as I learnt to call
it, and to think it) was soft and luxurious, and seemed somehow to give
one&rsquo;s body rest just in that part where one most needed it.</p>
<p>I was not at my ease that first day, nor indeed for many days afterwards,
notwithstanding my chair was so comfortable.&nbsp; Yet I forgot my sad
pain in silently wondering over the meaning of many of the things we
turned out of those curious old drawers.&nbsp; I was puzzled to know
why some were kept at all; a scrap of writing maybe, with only half
a dozen common-place words written on it, or a bit of broken riding-whip,
and here and there a stone, of which I thought I could have picked up
twenty just as good in the first walk I took.&nbsp; But it seems that
was just my ignorance; for my lady told me they were pieces of valuable
marble, used to make the floors of the great Roman emperors palaces
long ago; and that when she had been a girl, and made the grand tour
long ago, her cousin Sir Horace Mann, the Ambassador or Envoy at Florence,
had told her to be sure to go into the fields inside the walls of ancient
Rome, when the farmers were preparing the ground for the onion-sowing,
and had to make the soil fine, and pick up what bits of marble she could
find.&nbsp; She had done so, and meant to have had them made into a
table; but somehow that plan fell through, and there they were with
all the dirt out of the onion-field upon them; but once when I thought
of cleaning them with soap and water, at any rate, she bade me not to
do so, for it was Roman dirt&mdash;earth, I think, she called it&mdash;but
it was dirt all the same.</p>
<p>Then, in this bureau, were many other things, the value of which
I could understand&mdash;locks of hair carefully ticketed, which my
lady looked at very sadly; and lockets and bracelets with miniatures
in them,&mdash;very small pictures to what they make now-a-days, and
called miniatures: some of them had even to be looked at through a microscope
before you could see the individual expression of the faces, or how
beautifully they were painted.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that looking
at these made may lady seem so melancholy, as the seeing and touching
of the hair did.&nbsp; But, to be sure, the hair was, as it were, a
part of some beloved body which she might never touch and caress again,
but which lay beneath the turf, all faded and disfigured, except perhaps
the very hair, from which the lock she held had been dissevered; whereas
the pictures were but pictures after all&mdash;likenesses, but not the
very things themselves.&nbsp; This is only my own conjecture, mind.&nbsp;
My lady rarely spoke out her feelings.&nbsp; For, to begin with, she
was of rank: and I have heard her say that people of rank do not talk
about their feelings except to their equals, and even to them they conceal
them, except upon rare occasions.&nbsp; Secondly,&mdash;and this is
my own reflection,&mdash;she was an only child and an heiress; and as
such was more apt to think than to talk, as all well-brought-up heiresses
must be.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; Thirdly, she had long been a widow, without
any companion of her own age with whom it would have been natural for
her to refer to old associations, past pleasures, or mutual sorrows.&nbsp;
Mrs. Medlicott came nearest to her as a companion of this sort; and
her ladyship talked more to Mrs. Medlicott, in a kind of familiar way,
than she did to all the rest of the household put together.&nbsp; But
Mrs. Medlicott was silent by nature, and did not reply at any great
length.&nbsp; Adams, indeed, was the only one who spoke much to Lady
Ludlow.</p>
<p>After we had worked away about an hour at the bureau, her ladyship
said we had done enough for one day; and as the time was come for her
afternoon ride, she left me, with a volume of engravings from Mr. Hogarth&rsquo;s
pictures on one side of me (I don&rsquo;t like to write down the names
of them, though my lady thought nothing of it, I am sure), and upon
a stand her great prayer-book open at the evening psalms for the day,
on the other.&nbsp; But as soon as she was gone, I troubled myself little
with either, but amused myself with looking round the room at my leisure.&nbsp;
The side on which the fire-place stood was all panelled,&mdash;part
of the old ornaments of the house, for there was an Indian paper with
birds and beasts and insects on it, on all the other sides.&nbsp; There
were coats of arms, of the various families with whom the Hanburys had
intermarried, all over these panels, and up and down the ceiling as
well.&nbsp; There was very little looking-glass in the room, though
one of the great drawing-rooms was called the &ldquo;Mirror Room,&rdquo;
because it was lined with glass, which my lady&rsquo;s great-grandfather
had brought from Venice when he was ambassador there.&nbsp; There were
china jars of all shapes and sizes round and about the room, and some
china monsters, or idols, of which I could never bear the sight, they
were so ugly, though I think my lady valued them more than all.&nbsp;
There was a thick carpet on the middle of the floor, which was made
of small pieces of rare wood fitted into a pattern; the doors were opposite
to each other, and were composed of two heavy tall wings, and opened
in the middle, moving on brass grooves inserted into the floor&mdash;they
would not have opened over a carpet.&nbsp; There were two windows reaching
up nearly to the ceiling, but very narrow and with deep window-seats
in the thickness of the wall.&nbsp; The room was full of scent, partly
from the flowers outside, and partly from the great jars of pot-pourri
inside.&nbsp; The choice of odours was what my lady piqued herself upon,
saying nothing showed birth like a keen susceptibility of smell.&nbsp;
We never named musk in her presence, her antipathy to it was so well
understood through the household: her opinion on the subject was believed
to be, that no scent derived from an animal could ever be of a sufficiently
pure nature to give pleasure to any person of good family, where, of
course, the delicate perception of the senses had been cultivated for
generations.&nbsp; She would instance the way in which sportsmen preserve
the breed of dogs who have shown keen scent; and how such gifts descend
for generations amongst animals, who cannot be supposed to have anything
of ancestral pride, or hereditary fancies about them.&nbsp; Musk, then,
was never mentioned at Hanbury Court.&nbsp; No more were bergamot or
southern-wood, although vegetable in their nature.&nbsp; She considered
these two latter as betraying a vulgar taste in the person who chose
to gather or wear them.&nbsp; She was sorry to notice sprigs of them
in the button-hole of any young man in whom she took an interest, either
because he was engaged to a servant of hers or otherwise, as he came
out of church on a Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; She was afraid that he liked
coarse pleasures; and I am not sure if she did not think that his preference
for these coarse sweetnesses did not imply a probability that he would
take to drinking.&nbsp; But she distinguished between vulgar and common.&nbsp;
Violets, pinks, and sweetbriar were common enough; roses and mignionette,
for those who had gardens, honeysuckle for those who walked along the
bowery lanes; but wearing them betrayed no vulgarity of taste: the queen
upon her throne might be glad to smell at a nosegay of the flowers.&nbsp;
A beau-pot (as we called it) of pinks and roses freshly gathered was
placed every morning that they were in bloom on my lady&rsquo;s own
particular table.&nbsp; For lasting vegetable odours she preferred lavender
and sweet-woodroof to any extract whatever.&nbsp; Lavender reminded
her of old customs, she said, and of homely cottage-gardens, and many
a cottager made his offering to her of a bundle of lavender.&nbsp; Sweet
woodroof, again, grew in wild, woodland places where the soil was fine
and the air delicate: the poor children used to go and gather it for
her up in the woods on the higher lands; and for this service she always
rewarded them with bright new pennies, of which my lord, her son, used
to send her down a bagful fresh from the Mint in London every February.</p>
<p>Attar of roses, again, she disliked.&nbsp; She said it reminded her
of the city and of merchants&rsquo; wives, over-rich, over-heavy in
its perfume.&nbsp; And lilies-of-the-valley somehow fell under the same
condemnation.&nbsp; They were most graceful and elegant to look at (my
lady was quite candid about this), flower, leaf, colour&mdash;everything
was refined about them but the smell.&nbsp; That was too strong.&nbsp;
But the great hereditary faculty on which my lady piqued herself, and
with reason, for I never met with any person who possessed it, was the
power she had of perceiving the delicious odour arising from a bed of
strawberries in the late autumn, when the leaves were all fading and
dying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bacon&rsquo;s Essays&rdquo; was one of the few books
that lay about in my lady&rsquo;s room; and if you took it up and opened
it carelessly, it was sure to fall apart at his &ldquo;Essay on Gardens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; her ladyship would say, &ldquo;to what that great
philosopher and statesman says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Next to that,&rsquo;&mdash;he
is speaking of violets, my dear,&mdash;&lsquo;is the musk-rose,&rsquo;&mdash;of
which you remember the great bush, at the corner of the south wall just
by the Blue Drawing-room windows; that is the old musk-rose, Shakespeare&rsquo;s
musk-rose, which is dying out through the kingdom now.&nbsp; But to
return to my Lord Bacon: &lsquo;Then the strawberry leaves, dying with
a most excellent cordial smell.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the Hanburys can always
smell this excellent cordial odour, and very delicious and refreshing
it is.&nbsp; You see, in Lord Bacon&rsquo;s time, there had not been
so many intermarriages between the court and the city as there have
been since the needy days of his Majesty Charles the Second; and altogether
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, the great, old families of England were
a distinct race, just as a cart-horse is one creature, and very useful
in its place, and Childers or Eclipse is another creature, though both
are of the same species.&nbsp; So the old families have gifts and powers
of a different and higher class to what the other orders have.&nbsp;
My dear, remember that you try if you can smell the scent of dying strawberry-leaves
in this next autumn.&nbsp; You have some of Ursula Hanbury&rsquo;s blood
in you, and that gives you a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when October came, I sniffed and sniffed, and all to no purpose;
and my lady&mdash;who had watched the little experiment rather anxiously&mdash;had
to give me up as a hybrid.&nbsp; I was mortified, I confess, and thought
that it was in some ostentation of her own powers that she ordered the
gardener to plant a border of strawberries on that side of the terrace
that lay under her windows.</p>
<p>I have wandered away from time and place.&nbsp; I tell you all the
remembrances I have of those years just as they come up, and I hope
that, in my old age, I am not getting too like a certain Mrs. Nickleby,
whose speeches were once read out aloud to me.</p>
<p>I came by degrees to be all day long in this room which I have been
describing; sometimes sitting in the easy-chair, doing some little piece
of dainty work for my lady, or sometimes arranging flowers, or sorting
letters according to their handwriting, so that she could arrange them
afterwards, and destroy or keep, as she planned, looking ever onward
to her death.&nbsp; Then, after the sofa was brought in, she would watch
my face, and if she saw my colour change, she would bid me lie down
and rest.&nbsp; And I used to try to walk upon the terrace every day
for a short time: it hurt me very much, it is true, but the doctor had
ordered it, and I knew her ladyship wished me to obey.</p>
<p>Before I had seen the background of a great lady&rsquo;s life, I
had thought it all play and fine doings.&nbsp; But whatever other grand
people are, my lady was never idle.&nbsp; For one thing, she had to
superintend the agent for the large Hanbury estate.&nbsp; I believe
it was mortgaged for a sum of money which had gone to improve the late
lord&rsquo;s Scotch lands; but she was anxious to pay off this before
her death, and so to leave her own inheritance free of incumbrance to
her son, the present Earl; whom, I secretly think, she considered a
greater person, as being the heir of the Hanburys (though through a
female line), than as being my Lord Ludlow with half a dozen other minor
titles.</p>
<p>With this wish of releasing her property from the mortgage, skilful
care was much needed in the management of it; and as far as my lady
could go, she took every pains.&nbsp; She had a great book, in which
every page was ruled into three divisions; on the first column was written
the date and the name of the tenant who addressed any letter on business
to her; on the second was briefly stated the subject of the letter,
which generally contained a request of some kind.&nbsp; This request
would be surrounded and enveloped in so many words, and often inserted
amidst so many odd reasons and excuses, that Mr. Horner (the steward)
would sometimes say it was like hunting through a bushel of chaff to
find a grain of wheat.&nbsp; Now, in the second column of this book,
the grain of meaning was placed, clean and dry, before her ladyship
every morning.&nbsp; She sometimes would ask to see the original letter;
sometimes she simply answered the request by a &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; or
a &ldquo;No;&rdquo; and often she would send for lenses and papers,
and examine them well, with Mr. Horner at her elbow, to see if such
petitions, as to be allowed to plough up pasture fields, were provided
for in the terms of the original agreement.&nbsp; On every Thursday
she made herself at liberty to see her tenants, from four to six in
the afternoon.&nbsp; Mornings would have suited my lady better, as far
as convenience went, and I believe the old custom had been to have these
lev&eacute;es (as her ladyship used to call them) held before twelve.&nbsp;
But, as she said to Mr. Horner, when he urged returning to the former
hours, it spoilt a whole day for a farmer, if he had to dress himself
in his best and leave his work in the forenoon (and my lady liked to
see her tenants come in their Sunday clothes; she would not say a word,
maybe, but she would take her spectacles slowly out, and put them on
with silent gravity, and look at a dirty or raggedly-dressed man so
solemnly and earnestly, that his nerves must have been pretty strong
if he did not wince, and resolve that, however poor he might be, soap
and water, and needle and thread, should be used before he again appeared
in her ladyship&rsquo;s anteroom).&nbsp; The out-lying tenants had always
a supper provided for them in the servants&rsquo;-hall on Thursdays,
to which, indeed all comers were welcome to sit down.&nbsp; For my lady
said, though there were not many hours left of a working man&rsquo;s
day when their business with her was ended, yet that they needed food
and rest, and that she should be ashamed if they sought either at the
Fighting Lion (called at this day the Hanbury Arms).&nbsp; They had
as much beer as they could drink while they were eating; and when the
food was cleared away, they had a cup a-piece of good ale, in which
the oldest tenant present, standing up, gave Madam&rsquo;s health; and
after that was drunk, they were expected to set off homewards; at any
rate, no more liquor was given them.&nbsp; The tenants one and all called
her &ldquo;Madam;&rdquo; for they recognized in her the married heiress
of the Hanburys, not the widow of a Lord Ludlow, of whom they and their
forefathers knew nothing; and against whose memory, indeed, there rankled
a dim unspoken grudge, the cause of which was accurately known to the
very few who understood the nature of a mortgage, and were therefore
aware that Madam&rsquo;s money had been taken to enrich my lord&rsquo;s
poor land in Scotland.&nbsp; I am sure&mdash;for you can understand
I was behind the scenes, as it were, and had many an opportunity of
seeing and hearing, as I lay or sat motionless in my lady&rsquo;s room
with the double doors open between it and the anteroom beyond, where
Lady Ludlow saw her steward, and gave audience to her tenants,&mdash;I
am certain, I say, that Mr. Horner was silently as much annoyed at the
money that was swallowed up by this mortgage as any one; and, some time
or other, he had probably spoken his mind out to my lady; for there
was a sort of offended reference on her part, and respectful submission
to blame on his, while every now and then there was an implied protest&mdash;whenever
the payments of the interest became due, or whenever my lady stinted
herself of any personal expense, such as Mr. Horner thought was only
decorous and becoming in the heiress of the Hanburys.&nbsp; Her carriages
were old and cumbrous, wanting all the improvements which had been adopted
by those of her rank throughout the county.&nbsp; Mr. Horner would fain
have had the ordering of a new coach.&nbsp; The carriage-horses, too,
were getting past their work; yet all the promising colts bred on the
estate were sold for ready money; and so on.&nbsp; My lord, her son,
was ambassador at some foreign place; and very proud we all were of
his glory and dignity; but I fancy it cost money, and my lady would
have lived on bread and water sooner than have called upon him to help
her in paying off the mortgage, although he was the one who was to benefit
by it in the end.</p>
<p>Mr. Horner was a very faithful steward, and very respectful to my
lady; although sometimes, I thought she was sharper to him than to any
one else; perhaps because she knew that, although he never said anything,
he disapproved of the Hanburys being made to pay for the Earl Ludlow&rsquo;s
estates and state.</p>
<p>The late lord had been a sailor, and had been as extravagant in his
habits as most sailors are, I am told,&mdash;for I never saw the sea;
and yet he had a long sight to his own interests; but whatever he was,
my lady loved him and his memory, with about as fond and proud a love
as ever wife gave husband, I should think.</p>
<p>For a part of his life Mr. Horner, who was born on the Hanbury property,
had been a clerk to an attorney in Birmingham; and these few years had
given him a kind of worldly wisdom, which, though always exerted for
her benefit, was antipathetic to her ladyship, who thought that some
of her steward&rsquo;s maxims savoured of trade and commerce.&nbsp;
I fancy that if it had been possible, she would have preferred a return
to the primitive system, of living on the produce of the land, and exchanging
the surplus for such articles as were needed, without the intervention
of money.</p>
<p>But Mr. Horner was bitten with new-fangled notions, as she would
say, though his new-fangled notions were what folk at the present day
would think sadly behindhand; and some of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s ideas fell
on Mr. Horner&rsquo;s mind like sparks on tow, though they started from
two different points.&nbsp; Mr. Horner wanted to make every man useful
and active in this world, and to direct as much activity and usefulness
as possible to the improvement of the Hanbury estates, and the aggrandisement
of the Hanbury family, and therefore he fell into the new cry for education.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray did not care much,&mdash;Mr. Horner thought not enough,&mdash;for
this world, and where any man or family stood in their earthly position;
but he would have every one prepared for the world to come, and capable
of understanding and receiving certain doctrines, for which latter purpose,
it stands to reason, he must have heard of these doctrines; and therefore
Mr. Gray wanted education.&nbsp; The answer in the Catechism that Mr.
Horner was most fond of calling upon a child to repeat, was that to,
&ldquo;What is thy duty towards thy neighbour?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer
Mr. Gray liked best to hear repeated with unction, was that to the question,
&ldquo;What is the inward and spiritual grace?&rdquo;&nbsp; The reply
to which Lady Ludlow bent her head the lowest, as we said our Catechism
to her on Sundays, was to, &ldquo;What is thy duty towards God?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But neither Mr. Horner nor Mr. Gray had heard many answers to the Catechism
as yet.</p>
<p>Up to this time there was no Sunday-school in Hanbury.&nbsp; Mr.
Gray&rsquo;s desires were bounded by that object.&nbsp; Mr. Horner looked
farther on: he hoped for a day-school at some future time, to train
up intelligent labourers for working on the estate.&nbsp; My lady would
hear of neither one nor the other: indeed, not the boldest man whom
she ever saw would have dared to name the project of a day-school within
her hearing.</p>
<p>So Mr. Horner contented himself with quietly teaching a sharp, clever
lad to read and write, with a view to making use of him as a kind of
foreman in process of time.&nbsp; He had his pick of the farm-lads for
this purpose; and, as the brightest and sharpest, although by far the
raggedest and dirtiest, singled out Job Gregson&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; But
all this&mdash;as my lady never listened to gossip, or indeed, was spoken
to unless she spoke first&mdash;was quite unknown to her, until the
unlucky incident took place which I am going to relate.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>I think my lady was not aware of Mr. Horner&rsquo;s views on education
(as making men into more useful members of society), or the practice
to which he was putting his precepts in taking Harry Gregson as pupil
and prot&eacute;g&eacute;; if, indeed, she were aware of Harry&rsquo;s
distinct existence at all, until the following unfortunate occasion.&nbsp;
The anteroom, which was a kind of business-place for my lady to receive
her steward and tenants in, was surrounded by shelves.&nbsp; I cannot
call them book-shelves, though there were many books on them; but the
contents of the volumes were principally manuscript, and relating to
details connected with the Hanbury property.&nbsp; There were also one
or two dictionaries, gazetteers, works of reference on the management
of property; all of a very old date (the dictionary was Bailey&rsquo;s,
I remember; we had a great Johnson in my lady&rsquo;s room, but where
lexicographers differed, she generally preferred Bailey).</p>
<p>In this antechamber a footman generally sat, awaiting orders from
my lady; for she clung to the grand old customs, and despised any bells,
except her own little hand-bell, as modern inventions; she would have
her people always within summons of this silvery bell, or her scarce
less silvery voice.&nbsp; This man had not the sinecure you might imagine.&nbsp;
He had to reply to the private entrance; what we should call the back
door in a smaller house.&nbsp; As none came to the front door but my
lady, and those of the county whom she honoured by visiting, and her
nearest acquaintance of this kind lived eight miles (of bad road) off,
the majority of comers knocked at the nail-studded terrace-door; not
to have it opened (for open it stood, by my lady&rsquo;s orders, winter
and summer, so that the snow often drifted into the back hall, and lay
there in heaps when the weather was severe), but to summon some one
to receive their message, or carry their request to be allowed to speak
to my lady.&nbsp; I remember it was long before Mr. Gray could be made
to understand that the great door was only open on state occasions,
and even to the last he would as soon come in by that as the terrace
entrance.&nbsp; I had been received there on my first setting foot over
my lady&rsquo;s threshold; every stranger was led in by that way the
first time they came; but after that (with the exceptions I have named)
they went round by the terrace, as it were by instinct.&nbsp; It was
an assistance to this instinct to be aware that from time immemorial,
the magnificent and fierce Hanbury wolf-hounds, which were extinct in
every other part of the island, had been and still were kept chained
in the front quadrangle, where they bayed through a great part of the
day and night and were always ready with their deep, savage growl at
the sight of every person and thing, excepting the man who fed them,
my lady&rsquo;s carriage and four, and my lady herself.&nbsp; It was
pretty to see her small figure go up to the great, crouching brutes
thumping the flags with their heavy, wagging tails, and slobbering in
an ecstacy of delight, at her light approach and soft caress.&nbsp;
She had no fear of them; but she was a Hanbury born, and the tale went,
that they and their kind knew all Hanburys instantly, and acknowledged
their supremacy, ever since the ancestors of the breed had been brought
from the East by the great Sir Urian Hanbury, who lay with his legs
crossed on the altar-tomb in the church.&nbsp; Moreover, it was reported
that, not fifty years before, one of these dogs had eaten up a child,
which had inadvertently strayed within reach of its chain.&nbsp; So
you may imagine how most people preferred the terrace-door.&nbsp; Mr.
Gray did not seem to care for the dogs.&nbsp; It might be absence of
mind, for I have heard of his starting away from their sudden spring
when he had unwittingly walked within reach of their chains: but it
could hardly have been absence of mind, when one day he went right up
to one of them, and patted him in the most friendly manner, the dog
meanwhile looking pleased, and affably wagging his tail, just as if
Mr. Gray had been a Hanbury.&nbsp; We were all very much puzzled by
this, and to this day I have not been able to account for it.</p>
<p>But now let us go back to the terrace-door, and the footman sitting
in the antechamber.</p>
<p>One morning we heard a parleying, which rose to such a vehemence,
and lasted for so long, that my lady had to ring her hand-bell twice
before the footman heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, John?&rdquo; asked she, when he entered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little boy, my lady, who says he comes from Mr. Horner,
and must see your ladyship.&nbsp; Impudent little lad!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(This last to himself.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I have asked him, my lady, but he won&rsquo;t
tell me, please your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, probably, some message from Mr. Horner,&rdquo; said
Lady Ludlow, with just a shade of annoyance in her manner; for it was
against all etiquette to send a message to her, and by such a messenger
too!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! please your ladyship, I asked him if he had any message,
and he said no, he had none; but he must see your ladyship for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better show him in then, without more words,&rdquo;
said her ladyship, quietly, but still, as I have said, rather annoyed.</p>
<p>As if in mockery of the humble visitor, the footman threw open both
battants of the door, and in the opening there stood a lithe, wiry lad,
with a thick head of hair, standing out in every direction, as if stirred
by some electrical current, a short, brown face, red now from affright
and excitement, wide, resolute mouth, and bright, deep-set eyes, which
glanced keenly and rapidly round the room, as if taking in everything
(and all was new and strange), to be thought and puzzled over at some
future time.&nbsp; He knew enough of manners not to speak first to one
above him in rank, or else he was afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; asked my lady; in so gentle
a tone that it seemed to surprise and stun him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please your ladyship?&rdquo; said he, as if he
had been deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come from Mr. Horner&rsquo;s: why do you want to see me?&rdquo;
again asked she, a little more loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please your ladyship, Mr. Horner was sent for all
on a sudden to Warwick this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face began to work; but he felt it, and closed his lips into
a resolute form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he went off all on a sudden like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he left a note for your ladyship with me, your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&nbsp; You might have given it to the footman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please your ladyship, I&rsquo;ve clean gone and lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never took his eyes off her face.&nbsp; If he had not kept his
look fixed, he would have burst out crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very careless,&rdquo; said my lady gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I am sure you are very sorry for it.&nbsp; You had better
try and find it; it may have been of consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, mum&mdash;please your ladyship&mdash;I can say it
off by heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&nbsp; What do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was really afraid
now.&nbsp; My lady&rsquo;s blue eyes absolutely gave out light, she
was so much displeased, and, moreover, perplexed.&nbsp; The more reason
he had for affright, the more his courage rose.&nbsp; He must have seen,&mdash;so
sharp a lad must have perceived her displeasure; but he went on quickly
and steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Horner, my lady, has taught me to read, write, and cast
accounts, my lady.&nbsp; And he was in a hurry, and he folded his paper
up, but he did not seal it; and I read it, my lady; and now, my lady,
it seems like as if I had got it off by heart;&rdquo; and he went on
with a high pitched voice, saying out very loud what, I have no doubt,
were the identical words of the letter, date, signature and all: it
was merely something about a deed, which required my lady&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>When he had done, he stood almost as if he expected commendation
for his accurate memory.</p>
<p>My lady&rsquo;s eyes contracted till the pupils were as needle-points;
it was a way she had when much disturbed.&nbsp; She looked at me and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret Dawson, what will this world come to?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then she was silent.</p>
<p>The lad, beginning to perceive he had given deep offence, stood stock
still&mdash;as if his brave will had brought him into this presence,
and impelled him to confession, and the best amends he could make, but
had now deserted him, or was extinct, and left his body motionless,
until some one else with word or deed made him quit the room.&nbsp;
My lady looked again at him, and saw the frowning, dumb-foundering terror
at his misdeed, and the manner in which his confession had been received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor lad!&rdquo; said she, the angry look leaving her face,
&ldquo;into whose hands have you fallen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s lips began to quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what tree we read of in Genesis?&mdash;No!&nbsp;
I hope you have not got to read so easily as that.&rdquo;&nbsp; A pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who has taught you to read and write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, my lady, I meant no harm, my lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was fairly blubbering, overcome by her evident feeling of dismay and
regret, the soft repression of which was more frightening to him than
any strong or violent words would have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught you, I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were Mr. Horner&rsquo;s clerk who learned me, my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did Mr. Horner know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady.&nbsp; And I am sure I thought for to please
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! perhaps you were not to blame for that.&nbsp; But I
wonder at Mr. Horner.&nbsp; However, my boy, as you have got possession
of edge-tools, you must have some rules how to use them.&nbsp; Did you
never hear that you were not to open letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, my lady, it were open.&nbsp; Mr. Horner forgot for
to seal it, in his hurry to be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must not read letters that are not intended for you.&nbsp;
You must never try to read any letters that are not directed to you,
even if they be open before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, may lady, I thought it were good for practice, all
as one as a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady looked bewildered as to what way she could farther explain
to him the laws of honour as regarded letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not listen, I am sure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to
anything you were not intended to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, partly because he did not fully comprehend
the question.&nbsp; My lady repeated it.&nbsp; The light of intelligence
came into his eager eyes, and I could see that he was not certain if
he could tell the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, my lady, I always hearken when I hear folk talking
secrets; but I mean no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My poor lady sighed: she was not prepared to begin a long way off
in morals.&nbsp; Honour was, to her, second nature, and she had never
tried to find out on what principle its laws were based.&nbsp; So, telling
the lad that she wished to see Mr. Horner when he returned from Warwick,
she dismissed him with a despondent look; he, meanwhile, right glad
to be out of the awful gentleness of her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said she, half to herself and half
to me.&nbsp; I could not answer, for I was puzzled myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a right word,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that I used,
when I called reading and writing &lsquo;edge-tools.&rsquo;&nbsp; If
our lower orders have these edge-tools given to them, we shall have
the terrible scenes of the French Revolution acted over again in England.&nbsp;
When I was a girl, one never heard of the rights of men, one only heard
of the duties.&nbsp; Now, here was Mr. Gray, only last night, talking
of the right every child had to instruction.&nbsp; I could hardly keep
my patience with him, and at length we fairly came to words; and I told
him I would have no such thing as a Sunday-school (or a Sabbath-school,
as he calls it, just like a Jew) in my village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say, my lady?&rdquo; I asked; for the struggle
that seemed now to have come to a crisis, had been going on for some
time in a quiet way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he gave way to temper, and said he was bound to remember,
he was under the bishop&rsquo;s authority, not under mine; and implied
that he should persevere in his designs, notwithstanding my expressed
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your ladyship&mdash;&rdquo; I half inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could only rise and curtsey, and civilly dismiss him.&nbsp;
When two persons have arrived at a certain point of expression on a
subject, about which they differ as materially as I do from Mr. Gray,
the wisest course, if they wish to remain friends, is to drop the conversation
entirely and suddenly.&nbsp; It is one of the few cases where abruptness
is desirable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was sorry for Mr. Gray.&nbsp; He had been to see me several times,
and had helped me to bear my illness in a better spirit than I should
have done without his good advice and prayers.&nbsp; And I had gathered
from little things he said, how much his heart was set upon this new
scheme.&nbsp; I liked him so much, and I loved and respected my lady
so well, that I could not bear them to be on the cool terms to which
they were constantly getting.&nbsp; Yet I could do nothing but keep
silence.</p>
<p>I suppose my lady understood something of what was passing in my
mind; for, after a minute or two, she went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Gray knew all I know,&mdash;if he had my experience,
he would not be so ready to speak of setting up his new plans in opposition
to my judgment.&nbsp; Indeed,&rdquo; she continued, lashing herself
up with her own recollections, &ldquo;times are changed when the parson
of a village comes to beard the liege lady in her own house.&nbsp; Why,
in my grandfather&rsquo;s days, the parson was family chaplain too,
and dined at the Hall every Sunday.&nbsp; He was helped last, and expected
to have done first.&nbsp; I remember seeing him take up his plate and
knife and fork, and say with his mouth full all the time he was speaking:
&lsquo;If you please, Sir Urian, and my lady, I&rsquo;ll follow the
beef into the housekeeper&rsquo;s room;&rsquo; for you see, unless he
did so, he stood no chance of a second helping.&nbsp; A greedy man,
that parson was, to be sure!&nbsp; I recollect his once eating up the
whole of some little bird at dinner, and by way of diverting attention
from his greediness, he told how he had heard that a rook soaked in
vinegar and then dressed in a particular way, could not be distinguished
from the bird he was then eating.&nbsp; I saw by the grim look of my
grandfather&rsquo;s face that the parson&rsquo;s doing and saying displeased
him; and, child as I was, I had some notion of what was coming, when,
as I was riding out on my little, white pony, by my grandfather&rsquo;s
side, the next Friday, he stopped one of the gamekeepers, and bade him
shoot one of the oldest rooks he could find.&nbsp; I knew no more about
it till Sunday, when a dish was set right before the parson, and Sir
Urian said: &lsquo;Now, Parson Hemming, I have had a rook shot, and
soaked in vinegar, and dressed as you described last Sunday.&nbsp; Fall
to, man, and eat it with as good an appetite as you had last Sunday.&nbsp;
Pick the bones clean, or by&mdash;, no more Sunday dinners shall you
eat at my table!&rsquo;&nbsp; I gave one look at poor Mr. Hemming&rsquo;s
face, as he tried to swallow the first morsel, and make believe as though
he thought it very good; but I could not look again, for shame, although
my grandfather laughed, and kept asking us all round if we knew what
could have become of the parson&rsquo;s appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he finish it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, my dear.&nbsp; What my grandfather said was to be done,
was done always.&nbsp; He was a terrible man in his anger!&nbsp; But
to think of the difference between Parson Hemming and Mr. Gray! or even
of poor dear Mr. Mountford and Mr. Gray.&nbsp; Mr. Mountford would never
have withstood me as Mr. Gray did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your ladyship really thinks that it would not be right
to have a Sunday-school?&rdquo; I asked, feeling very timid as I put
time question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; As I told Mr. Gray.&nbsp; I consider
a knowledge of the Creed, and of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, as essential
to salvation; and that any child may have, whose parents bring it regularly
to church.&nbsp; Then there are the Ten Commandments, which teach simple
duties in the plainest language.&nbsp; Of course, if a lad is taught
to read and write (as that unfortunate boy has been who was here this
morning) his duties become complicated, and his temptations much greater,
while, at the same time, he has no hereditary principles and honourable
training to serve as safeguards.&nbsp; I might take up my old simile
of the race-horse and cart-horse.&nbsp; I am distressed,&rdquo; continued
she, with a break in her ideas, &ldquo;about that boy.&nbsp; The whole
thing reminds me so much of a story of what happened to a friend of
mine&mdash;Cl&eacute;ment de Cr&eacute;quy.&nbsp; Did I ever tell you
about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your ladyship,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Cl&eacute;ment!&nbsp; More than twenty years ago, Lord
Ludlow and I spent a winter in Paris.&nbsp; He had many friends there;
perhaps not very good or very wise men, but he was so kind that he liked
every one, and every one liked him.&nbsp; We had an apartment, as they
call it there, in the Rue de Lille; we had the first-floor of a grand
h&ocirc;tel, with the basement for our servants.&nbsp; On the floor
above us the owner of the house lived, a Marquise de Cr&eacute;quy,
a widow.&nbsp; They tell me that the Cr&eacute;quy coat-of-arms is still
emblazoned, after all these terrible years, on a shield above the arched
porte-coch&egrave;re, just as it was then, though the family is quite
extinct.&nbsp; Madame de Cr&eacute;quy had only one son, Cl&eacute;ment,
who was just the same age as my Urian&mdash;you may see his portrait
in the great hall&mdash;Urian&rsquo;s, I mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew that
Master Urian had been drowned at sea; and often had I looked at the
presentment of his bonny hopeful face, in his sailor&rsquo;s dress,
with right hand outstretched to a ship on the sea in the distance, as
if he had just said, &ldquo;Look at her! all her sails are set, and
I&rsquo;m just off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Master Urian! he went down in
this very ship not a year after the picture was taken!&nbsp; But now
I will go back to my lady&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see those
two boys playing now,&rdquo; continued she, softly, shutting her eyes,
as if the better to call up the vision, &ldquo;as they used to do five-and-twenty
years ago in those old-fashioned French gardens behind our h&ocirc;tel.&nbsp;
Many a time have I watched them from my windows.&nbsp; It was, perhaps,
a better play-place than an English garden would have been, for there
were but few flower-beds, and no lawn at all to speak about; but, instead,
terraces and balustrades and vases and flights of stone steps more in
the Italian style; and there were jets-d&rsquo;eau, and little fountains
that could be set playing by turning water-cocks that were hidden here
and there.&nbsp; How Cl&eacute;ment delighted in turning the water on
to surprise Urian, and how gracefully he did the honours, as it were,
to my dear, rough, sailor lad!&nbsp; Urian was as dark as a gipsy boy,
and cared little for his appearance, and resisted all my efforts at
setting off his black eyes and tangled curls; but Cl&eacute;ment, without
ever showing that he thought about himself and his dress, was always
dainty and elegant, even though his clothes were sometimes but threadbare.&nbsp;
He used to be dressed in a kind of hunter&rsquo;s green suit, open at
the neck and half-way down the chest to beautiful old lace frills; his
long golden curls fell behind just like a girl&rsquo;s, and his hair
in front was cut over his straight dark eyebrows in a line almost as
straight.&nbsp; Urian learnt more of a gentleman&rsquo;s carefulness
and propriety of appearance from that lad in two months than he had
done in years from all my lectures.&nbsp; I recollect one day, when
the two boys were in full romp&mdash;and, my window being open, I could
hear them perfectly&mdash;and Urian was daring Cl&eacute;ment to some
scrambling or climbing, which Cl&eacute;ment refused to undertake, but
in a hesitating way, as though he longed to do it if some reason had
not stood in the way; and at times, Urian, who was hasty and thoughtless,
poor fellow, told Cl&eacute;ment that he was afraid.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear!&rsquo;
said the French boy, drawing himself up; &lsquo;you do not know what
you say.&nbsp; If you will be here at six to-morrow morning, when it
is only just light, I will take that starling&rsquo;s nest on the top
of yonder chimney.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But why not now, Cl&eacute;ment?&rsquo;
said Urian, putting his arm round Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why then, and not now, just when we are in the humour for it?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Because we De Cr&eacute;quys are poor, and my mother cannot afford
me another suit of clothes this year, and yonder stone carving is all
jagged, and would tear my coat and breeches.&nbsp; Now, to-morrow morning
I could go up with nothing on but an old shirt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you would tear your legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My race do not care for pain,&rsquo; said the boy,
drawing himself from Urian&rsquo;s arm, and walking a few steps away,
with a becoming pride and reserve; for he was hurt at being spoken to
as if he were afraid, and annoyed at having to confess the true reason
for declining the feat.&nbsp; But Urian was not to be thus baffled.&nbsp;
He went up to Cl&eacute;ment, and put his arm once more about his neck,
and I could see the two lads as they walked down the terrace away from
the hotel windows: first Urian spoke eagerly, looking with imploring
fondness into Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s face, which sought the ground,
till at last the French boy spoke, and by-and-by his arm was round Urian
too, and they paced backwards and forwards in deep talk, but gravely,
as became men, rather than boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All at once, from the little chapel at the corner of the large
garden belonging to the Missions Etrang&egrave;res, I heard the tinkle
of the little bell, announcing the elevation of the host.&nbsp; Down
on his knees went Cl&eacute;ment, hands crossed, eyes bent down: while
Urian stood looking on in respectful thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a friendship that might have been!&nbsp; I never dream
of Urian without seeing Cl&eacute;ment too&mdash;Urian speaks to me,
or does something,&mdash;but Cl&eacute;ment only flits round Urian,
and never seems to see any one else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not forget to tell you, that the next morning,
before he was out of his room, a footman of Madame de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s
brought Urian the starling&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! we came back to England, and the boys were to correspond;
and Madame de Cr&eacute;quy and I exchanged civilities; and Urian went
to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, all seemed to drop away.&nbsp; I cannot tell you
all.&nbsp; However, to confine myself to the De Cr&eacute;quys.&nbsp;
I had a letter from Cl&eacute;ment; I knew he felt his friend&rsquo;s
death deeply; but I should never have learnt it from the letter he sent.&nbsp;
It was formal, and seemed like chaff to my hungering heart.&nbsp; Poor
fellow! I dare say he had found it hard to write.&nbsp; What could he&mdash;or
any one&mdash;say to a mother who has lost her child?&nbsp; The world
does not think so, and, in general, one must conform to the customs
of the world; but, judging from my own experience, I should say that
reverent silence at such times is the tenderest balm.&nbsp; Madame de
Cr&eacute;quy wrote too.&nbsp; But I knew she could not feel my loss
so much as Cl&eacute;ment, and therefore her letter was not such a disappointment.&nbsp;
She and I went on being civil and polite in the way of commissions,
and occasionally introducing friends to each other, for a year or two,
and then we ceased to have any intercourse.&nbsp; Then the terrible
Revolution came.&nbsp; No one who did not live at those times can imagine
the daily expectation of news&mdash;the hourly terror of rumours affecting
the fortunes and lives of those whom most of us had known as pleasant
hosts, receiving us with peaceful welcome in their magnificent houses.&nbsp;
Of course, there was sin enough and suffering enough behind the scenes;
but we English visitors to Paris had seen little or nothing of that,&mdash;and
I had sometimes thought, indeed, how even death seemed loth to choose
his victims out of that brilliant throng whom I had known.&nbsp; Madame
de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s one boy lived; while three out of my six were
gone since we had met!&nbsp; I do not think all lots are equal, even
now that I know the end of her hopes; but I do say that whatever our
individual lot is, it is our duty to accept it, without comparing it
with that of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The times were thick with gloom and terror.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
next?&rsquo; was the question we asked of every one who brought us news
from Paris.&nbsp; Where were these demons hidden when, so few years
ago, we danced and feasted, and enjoyed the brilliant salons and the
charming friendships of Paris?</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening, I was sitting alone in Saint James&rsquo;s Square;
my lord off at the club with Mr. Fox and others: he had left me, thinking
that I should go to one of the many places to which I had been invited
for that evening; but I had no heart to go anywhere, for it was poor
Urian&rsquo;s birthday, and I had not even rung for lights, though the
day was fast closing in, but was thinking over all his pretty ways,
and on his warm affectionate nature, and how often I had been too hasty
in speaking to him, for all I loved him so dearly; and how I seemed
to have neglected and dropped his dear friend Cl&eacute;ment, who might
even now be in need of help in that cruel, bloody Paris.&nbsp; I say
I was thinking reproachfully of all this, and particularly of Cl&eacute;ment
de Cr&eacute;quy in connection with Urian, when Fenwick brought me a
note, sealed with a coat-of-arms I knew well, though I could not remember
at the moment where I had seen it.&nbsp; I puzzled over it, as one does
sometimes, for a minute or more, before I opened the letter.&nbsp; In
a moment I saw it was from Cl&eacute;ment de Cr&eacute;quy.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
mother is here,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;she is very ill, and I am bewildered
in this strange country.&nbsp; May I entreat you to receive me for a
few minutes?&rsquo;&nbsp; The bearer of the note was the woman of the
house where they lodged.&nbsp; I had her brought up into the anteroom,
and questioned her myself, while my carriage was being brought round.&nbsp;
They had arrived in London a fortnight or so before: she had not known
their quality, judging them (according to her kind) by their dress and
their luggage; poor enough, no doubt.&nbsp; The lady had never left
her bedroom since her arrival; the young man waited upon her, did everything
for her, never left her, in fact; only she (the messenger) had promised
to stay within call, as soon as she returned, while he went out somewhere.&nbsp;
She could hardly understand him, he spoke English so badly.&nbsp; He
had never spoken it, I dare say, since he had talked to my Urian.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In the hurry of the moment I scarce knew what I did.&nbsp;
I bade the housekeeper put up every delicacy she had, in order to tempt
the invalid, whom yet I hoped to bring back with me to our house.&nbsp;
When the carriage was ready I took the good woman with me to show us
the exact way, which my coachman professed not to know; for, indeed,
they were staying at but a poor kind of place at the back of Leicester
Square, of which they had heard, as Cl&eacute;ment told me afterwards,
from one of the fishermen who had carried them across from the Dutch
coast in their disguises as a Friesland peasant and his mother.&nbsp;
They had some jewels of value concealed round their persons; but their
ready money was all spent before I saw them, and Cl&eacute;ment had
been unwilling to leave his mother, even for the time necessary to ascertain
the best mode of disposing of the diamonds.&nbsp; For, overcome with
distress of mind and bodily fatigue, she had reached London only to
take to her bed in a sort of low, nervous fever, in which her chief
and only idea seemed to be that Cl&eacute;ment was about to be taken
from her to some prison or other; and if he were out of her sight, though
but for a minute, she cried like a child, and could not be pacified
or comforted.&nbsp; The landlady was a kind, good woman, and though
she but half understood the case, she was truly sorry for them, as foreigners,
and the mother sick in a strange land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent her forwards to request permission for my entrance.&nbsp;
In a moment I saw Cl&eacute;ment&mdash;a tall, elegant young man, in
a curious dress of coarse cloth, standing at the open door of a room,
and evidently&mdash;even before he accosted me&mdash;striving to soothe
the terrors of his mother inside.&nbsp; I went towards him, and would
have taken his hand, but he bent down and kissed mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I come in, madame?&rsquo; I asked, looking at the
poor sick lady, lying in the dark, dingy bed, her head propped up on
coarse and dirty pillows, and gazing with affrighted eyes at all that
was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cl&eacute;ment!&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment! come to me!&rsquo;
she cried; and when he went to the bedside she turned on one side, and
took his hand in both of hers, and began stroking it, and looking up
in his face.&nbsp; I could scarce keep back my tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stood there quite still, except that from time to time
he spoke to her in a low tone.&nbsp; At last I advanced into the room,
so that I could talk to him, without renewing her alarm.&nbsp; I asked
for the doctor&rsquo;s address; for I had heard that they had called
in some one, at their landlady&rsquo;s recommendation: but I could hardly
understand Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s broken English, and mispronunciation
of our proper names, and was obliged to apply to the woman herself.&nbsp;
I could not say much to Cl&eacute;ment, for his attention was perpetually
needed by his mother, who never seemed to perceive that I was there.&nbsp;
But I told him not to fear, however long I might be away, for that I
would return before night; and, bidding the woman take charge of all
the heterogeneous things the housekeeper had put up, and leaving one
of my men in the house, who could understand a few words of French,
with directions that he was to hold himself at Madame de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s
orders until I sent or gave him fresh commands, I drove off to the doctor&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
What I wanted was his permission to remove Madame de Cr&eacute;quy to
my own house, and to learn how it best could be done; for I saw that
every movement in the room, every sound except Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s
voice, brought on a fresh access of trembling and nervous agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor was, I should think, a clever man; but he had that
kind of abrupt manner which people get who have much to do with the
lower orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him the story of his patient, the interest I had in
her, and the wish I entertained of removing her to my own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be done,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any
change will kill her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it must be done,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
it shall not kill her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I have nothing more to say,&rsquo; said he, turning
away from the carriage door, and making as though he would go back into
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stop a moment.&nbsp; You must help me; and, if you
do, you shall have reason to be glad, for I will give you fifty pounds
down with pleasure.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t do it, another shall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked at me, then (furtively) at the carriage, hesitated,
and then said: &lsquo;You do not mind expense, apparently.&nbsp; I suppose
you are a rich lady of quality.&nbsp; Such folks will not stick at such
trifles as the life or death of a sick woman to get their own way.&nbsp;
I suppose I must e&rsquo;en help you, for if I don&rsquo;t, another
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mind what he said, so that he would assist me.&nbsp;
I was pretty sure that she was in a state to require opiates; and I
had not forgotten Christopher Sly, you may be sure, so I told him what
I had in my head.&nbsp; That in the dead of night&mdash;the quiet time
in the streets,&mdash;she should be carried in a hospital litter, softly
and warmly covered over, from the Leicester Square lodging-house to
rooms that I would have in perfect readiness for her.&nbsp; As I planned,
so it was done.&nbsp; I let Cl&eacute;ment know, by a note, of my design.&nbsp;
I had all prepared at home, and we walked about my house as though shod
with velvet, while the porter watched at the open door.&nbsp; At last,
through the darkness, I saw the lanterns carried by my men, who were
leading the little procession.&nbsp; The litter looked like a hearse;
on one side walked the doctor, on the other Cl&eacute;ment; they came
softly and swiftly along.&nbsp; I could not try any farther experiment;
we dared not change her clothes; she was laid in the bed in the landlady&rsquo;s
coarse night-gear, and covered over warmly, and left in the shaded,
scented room, with a nurse and the doctor watching by her, while I led
Cl&eacute;ment to the dressing-room adjoining, in which I had had a
bed placed for him.&nbsp; Farther than that he would not go; and there
I had refreshments brought.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he had shown his gratitude
by every possible action (for we none of us dared to speak): he had
kneeled at my feet, and kissed my hand, and left it wet with his tears.&nbsp;
He had thrown up his arms to Heaven, and prayed earnestly, as I could
see by the movement of his lips.&nbsp; I allowed him to relieve himself
by these dumb expressions, if I may so call them,&mdash;and then I left
him, and went to my own rooms to sit up for my lord, and tell him what
I had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it was all right; and neither my lord nor I could
sleep for wondering how Madame de Cr&eacute;quy would bear her awakening.&nbsp;
I had engaged the doctor, to whose face and voice she was accustomed,
to remain with her all night: the nurse was experienced, and Cl&eacute;ment
was within call.&nbsp; But it was with the greatest relief that I heard
from my own woman, when she brought me my chocolate, that Madame de
Cr&eacute;quy (Monsieur had said) had awakened more tranquil than she
had been for many days.&nbsp; To be sure, the whole aspect of the bed-chamber
must have been more familiar to her than the miserable place where I
had found her, and she must have intuitively felt herself among friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord was scandalized at Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s dress, which,
after the first moment of seeing him I had forgotten, in thinking of
other things, and for which I had not prepared Lord Ludlow.&nbsp; He
sent for his own tailor, and bade him bring patterns of stuffs, and
engage his men to work night and day till Cl&eacute;ment could appear
as became his rank.&nbsp; In short, in a few days so much of the traces
of their flight were removed, that we had almost forgotten the terrible
causes of it, and rather felt as if they had come on a visit to us than
that they had been compelled to fly their country.&nbsp; Their diamonds,
too, were sold well by my lord&rsquo;s agents, though the London shops
were stocked with jewellery, and such portable valuables, some of rare
and curious fashion, which were sold for half their real value by emigrants
who could not afford to wait.&nbsp; Madame de Cr&eacute;quy was recovering
her health, although her strength was sadly gone, and she would never
be equal to such another flight, as the perilous one which she had gone
through, and to which she could not bear the slightest reference.&nbsp;
For some time things continued in this state&mdash;the De Cr&eacute;quys
still our honoured visitors,&mdash;many houses besides our own, even
among our own friends, open to receive the poor flying nobility of France,
driven from their country by the brutal republicans, and every freshly-arrived
emigrant bringing new tales of horror, as if these revolutionists were
drunk with blood, and mad to devise new atrocities.&nbsp; One day Cl&eacute;ment&mdash;I
should tell you he had been presented to our good King George and the
sweet Queen, and they had accosted him most graciously, and his beauty
and elegance, and some of the circumstances attendant on his flight,
made him be received in the world quite like a hero of romance; he might
have been on intimate terms in many a distinguished house, had he cared
to visit much; but he accompanied my lord and me with an air of indifference
and languor, which I sometimes fancied made him be all the more sought
after: Monkshaven (that was the title my eldest son bore) tried in vain
to interest him in all young men&rsquo;s sports.&nbsp; But no! it was
the same through all.&nbsp; His mother took far more interest in the
on-dits of the London world, into which she was far too great an invalid
to venture, than he did in the absolute events themselves, in which
he might have been an actor.&nbsp; One day, as I was saying, an old
Frenchman of a humble class presented himself to our servants, several
of them, understood French; and through Medlicott, I learnt that he
was in some way connected with the De Cr&eacute;quys; not with their
Paris-life; but I fancy he had been intendant of their estates in the
country; estates which were more useful as hunting-grounds than as adding
to their income.&nbsp; However, there was the old man and with him,
wrapped round his person, he had brought the long parchment rolls, and
deeds relating to their property.&nbsp; These he would deliver up to
none but Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy, the rightful owner; and Cl&eacute;ment
was out with Monkshaven, so the old man waited; and when Cl&eacute;ment
came in, I told him of the steward&rsquo;s arrival, and how he had been
cared for by my people.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment went directly to see him.&nbsp;
He was a long time away, and I was waiting for him to drive out with
me, for some purpose or another, I scarce know what, but I remember
I was tired of waiting, and was just in the act of ringing the bell
to desire that he might be reminded of his engagement with me, when
he came in, his face as white as the powder in his hair, his beautiful
eyes dilated with horror.&nbsp; I saw that he had heard something that
touched him even more closely than the usual tales which every fresh
emigrant brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it, Cl&eacute;ment?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He clasped his hands, and looked as though he tried to speak,
but could not bring out the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They have guillotined my uncle!&rsquo; said he at last.&nbsp;
Now, I knew that there was a Count de Cr&eacute;quy; but I had always
understood that the elder branch held very little communication with
him; in fact, that he was a vaurien of some kind, and rather a disgrace
than otherwise to the family.&nbsp; So, perhaps, I was hard-hearted
but I was a little surprised at this excess of emotion, till I saw that
peculiar look in his eyes that many people have when there is more terror
in their hearts than they dare put into words.&nbsp; He wanted me to
understand something without his saying it; but how could I?&nbsp; I
had never heard of a Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Virginie!&rsquo; at last he uttered.&nbsp; In an instant
I understood it all, and remembered that, if Urian had lived, he too
might have been in love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My cousin,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say, &lsquo;your betrothed,&rsquo; but I had no
doubt of it.&nbsp; I was mistaken, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O madame!&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;her mother died
long ago&mdash;her father now&mdash;and she is in daily fear,&mdash;alone,
deserted&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is she in the Abbaye?&rsquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No! she is in hiding with the widow of her father&rsquo;s
old concierge.&nbsp; Any day they may search the house for aristocrats.&nbsp;
They are seeking them everywhere.&nbsp; Then, not her life alone, but
that of the old woman, her hostess, is sacrificed.&nbsp; The old woman
knows this, and trembles with fear.&nbsp; Even if she is brave enough
to be faithful, her fears would betray her, should the house be searched.&nbsp;
Yet, there is no one to help Virginie to escape.&nbsp; She is alone
in Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw what was in his mind.&nbsp; He was fretting and chafing
to go to his cousin&rsquo;s assistance; but the thought of his mother
restrained him.&nbsp; I would not have kept back Urian from such on
errand at such a time.&nbsp; How should I restrain him?&nbsp; And yet,
perhaps, I did wrong in not urging the chances of danger more.&nbsp;
Still, if it was danger to him, was it not the same or even greater
danger to her?&mdash;for the French spared neither age nor sex in those
wicked days of terror.&nbsp; So I rather fell in with his wish, and
encouraged him to think how best and most prudently it might be fulfilled;
never doubting, as I have said, that he and his cousin were troth-plighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I went to Madame de Cr&eacute;quy&mdash;after he
had imparted his, or rather our plan to her&mdash;I found out my mistake.&nbsp;
She, who was in general too feeble to walk across the room save slowly,
and with a stick, was going from end to end with quick, tottering steps;
and, if now and then she sank upon a chair, it seemed as if she could
not rest, for she was up again in a moment, pacing along, wringing her
hands, and speaking rapidly to herself.&nbsp; When she saw me, she stopped:
&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you have lost your own boy.&nbsp;
You might have left me mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so astonished&mdash;I hardly knew what to say.&nbsp;
I had spoken to Cl&eacute;ment as if his mother&rsquo;s consent were
secure (as I had felt my own would have been if Urian had been alive
to ask it).&nbsp; Of coarse, both he and I knew that his mother&rsquo;s
consent must be asked and obtained, before he could leave her to go
on such an undertaking; but, somehow, my blood always rose at the sight
or sound of danger; perhaps, because my life had been so peaceful.&nbsp;
Poor Madame de Cr&eacute;quy! it was otherwise with her; she despaired
while I hoped, and Cl&eacute;ment trusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Madame de Cr&eacute;quy,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;he
will return safely to us; every precaution shall be taken, that either
he or you, or my lord, or Monkshaven can think of; but he cannot leave
a girl&mdash;his nearest relation save you&mdash;his betrothed, is she
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His betrothed!&rsquo; cried she, now at the utmost
pitch of her excitement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Virginie betrothed to Cl&eacute;ment?&mdash;no!
thank heaven, not so bad as that!&nbsp; Yet it might have been.&nbsp;
But mademoiselle scorned my son!&nbsp; She would have nothing to do
with him.&nbsp; Now is the time for him to have nothing to do with her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cl&eacute;ment had entered at the door behind his mother as
she thus spoke.&nbsp; His face was set and pale, till it looked as gray
and immovable as if it had been carved in stone.&nbsp; He came forward
and stood before his mother.&nbsp; She stopped her walk, threw back
her haughty head, and the two looked each other steadily in the face.&nbsp;
After a minute or two in this attitude, her proud and resolute gaze
never flinching or wavering, he went down upon one knee, and, taking
her hand&mdash;her hard, stony hand, which never closed on his, but
remained straight and stiff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he pleaded, &lsquo;withdraw your prohibition.&nbsp;
Let me go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What were her words?&rsquo; Madame de Cr&eacute;quy
replied, slowly, as if forcing her memory to the extreme of accuracy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My cousin,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;when I marry, I marry a man,
not a petit-ma&icirc;tre.&nbsp; I marry a man who, whatever his rank
may be will add dignity to the human race by his virtues, and not be
content to live in an effeminate court on the traditions of past grandeur.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She borrowed her words from the infamous Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the
friend of her scarce less infamous father&mdash;nay!&nbsp; I will say
it,&mdash;if not her words, she borrowed her principles.&nbsp; And my
son to request her to marry him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was my father&rsquo;s written wish,&rsquo; said
Cl&eacute;ment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But did you not love her?&nbsp; You plead your father&rsquo;s
words,&mdash;words written twelve years before,&mdash;and as if that
were your reason for being indifferent to my dislike to the alliance.&nbsp;
But you requested her to marry you,&mdash;and she refused you with insolent
contempt; and now you are ready to leave me,&mdash;leave me desolate
in a foreign land&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Desolate! my mother! and the Countess Ludlow stands
there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon, madame!&nbsp; But all the earth, though it
were full of kind hearts, is but a desolation and a desert place to
a mother when her only child is absent.&nbsp; And you, Cl&eacute;ment,
would leave me for this Virginie,&mdash;this degenerate De Cr&eacute;quy,
tainted with the atheism of the Encyclop&eacute;distes!&nbsp; She is
only reaping some of the fruit of the harvest whereof her friends have
sown the seed.&nbsp; Let her alone!&nbsp; Doubtless she has friends&mdash;it
may be lovers&mdash;among these demons, who, under the cry of liberty,
commit every licence.&nbsp; Let her alone, Cl&eacute;ment!&nbsp; She
refused you with scorn: be too proud to notice her now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother, I cannot think of myself; only of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Think of me, then!&nbsp; I, your mother, forbid you
to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cl&eacute;ment bowed low, and went out of the room instantly,
as one blinded.&nbsp; She saw his groping movement, and, for an instant,
I think her heart was touched.&nbsp; But she turned to me, and tried
to exculpate her past violence by dilating upon her wrongs, and they
certainly were many.&nbsp; The Count, her husband&rsquo;s younger brother,
had invariably tried to make mischief between husband and wife.&nbsp;
He had been the cleverer man of the two, and had possessed extraordinary
influence over her husband.&nbsp; She suspected him of having instigated
that clause in her husband&rsquo;s will, by which the Marquis expressed
his wish for the marriage of the cousins.&nbsp; The Count had had some
interest in the management of the De Cr&eacute;quy property during her
son&rsquo;s minority.&nbsp; Indeed, I remembered then, that it was through
Count de Cr&eacute;quy that Lord Ludlow had first heard of the apartment
which we afterwards took in the H&ocirc;tel de Cr&eacute;quy; and then
the recollection of a past feeling came distinctly out of the mist,
as it were; and I called to mind how, when we first took up our abode
in the H&ocirc;tel de Cr&eacute;quy, both Lord Ludlow and I imagined
that the arrangement was displeasing to our hostess; and how it had
taken us a considerable time before we had been able to establish relations
of friendship with her.&nbsp; Years after our visit, she began to suspect
that Cl&eacute;ment (whom she could not forbid to visit at his uncle&rsquo;s
house, considering the terms on which his father had been with his brother;
though she herself never set foot over the Count de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s
threshold) was attaching himself to mademoiselle, his cousin; and she
made cautious inquiries as to the appearance, character, and disposition
of the young lady.&nbsp; Mademoiselle was not handsome, they said; but
of a fine figure, and generally considered as having a very noble and
attractive presence.&nbsp; In character she was daring and wilful (said
one set); original and independent (said another).&nbsp; She was much
indulged by her father, who had given her something of a man&rsquo;s
education, and selected for her intimate friend a young lady below her
in rank, one of the Bureaucracie, a Mademoiselle Necker, daughter of
the Minister of Finance.&nbsp; Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy was thus
introduced into all the free-thinking salons of Paris; among people
who were always full of plans for subverting society.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
did Cl&eacute;ment affect such people?&rsquo; Madame de Cr&eacute;quy
had asked with some anxiety.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy
had neither eyes nor ears, nor thought for anything but his cousin,
while she was by.&nbsp; And she?&nbsp; She hardly took notice of his
devotion, so evident to every one else.&nbsp; The proud creature!&nbsp;
But perhaps that was her haughty way of concealing what she felt.&nbsp;
And so Madame de Cr&eacute;quy listened, and questioned, and learnt
nothing decided, until one day she surprised Cl&eacute;ment with the
note in his hand, of which she remembered the stinging words so well,
in which Virginie had said, in reply to a proposal Cl&eacute;ment had
sent her through her father, that &lsquo;When she married she married
a man, not a petit-ma&icirc;tre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cl&eacute;ment was justly indignant at the insulting nature
of the answer Virginie had sent to a proposal, respectful in its tone,
and which was, after all, but the cool, hardened lava over a burning
heart.&nbsp; He acquiesced in his mother&rsquo;s desire, that he should
not again present himself in his uncle&rsquo;s salons; but he did not
forget Virginie, though he never mentioned her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame de Cr&eacute;quy and her son were among the earliest
proscrits, as they were of the strongest possible royalists, and aristocrats,
as it was the custom of the horrid Sansculottes to term those who adhered
to the habits of expression and action in which it was their pride to
have been educated.&nbsp; They had left Paris some weeks before they
had arrived in England, and Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s belief at the time
of quitting the H&ocirc;tel de Cr&eacute;quy had certainly been, that
his uncle was not merely safe, but rather a popular man with the party
in power.&nbsp; And, as all communication having relation to private
individuals of a reliable kind was intercepted, Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy
had felt but little anxiety for his uncle and cousin, in comparison
with what he did for many other friends of very different opinions in
politics, until the day when he was stunned by the fatal information
that even his progressive uncle was guillotined, and learnt that his
cousin was imprisoned by the licence of the mob, whose rights (as she
called them) she was always advocating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had heard all this story, I confess I lost in sympathy
for Cl&eacute;ment what I gained for his mother.&nbsp; Virginie&rsquo;s
life did not seem to me worth the risk that Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s would
run.&nbsp; But when I saw him&mdash;sad, depressed, nay, hopeless&mdash;going
about like one oppressed by a heavy dream which he cannot shake off;
caring neither to eat, drink, nor sleep, yet bearing all with silent
dignity, and even trying to force a poor, faint smile when he caught
my anxious eyes; I turned round again, and wondered how Madame de Cr&eacute;quy
could resist this mute pleading of her son&rsquo;s altered appearance.&nbsp;
As for my Lord Ludlow and Monkshaven, as soon as they understood the
case, they were indignant that any mother should attempt to keep a son
out of honourable danger; and it was honourable, and a clear duty (according
to them) to try to save the life of a helpless orphan girl, his next
of kin.&nbsp; None but a Frenchman, said my lord, would hold himself
bound by an old woman&rsquo;s whimsies and fears, even though she were
his mother.&nbsp; As it was, he was chafing himself to death under the
restraint.&nbsp; If he went, to be sure, the wretches might make an
end of him, as they had done of many a fine fellow: but my lord would
take heavy odds, that, instead of being guillotined, he would save the
girl, and bring her safe to England, just desperately in love with her
preserver, and then we would have a jolly wedding down at Monkshaven.&nbsp;
My lord repeated his opinion so often that it became a certain prophecy
in his mind of what was to take place; and, one day seeing Cl&eacute;ment
look even paler and thinner than he had ever done before, he sent a
message to Madame de Cr&eacute;quy, requesting permission to speak to
her in private.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For, by George!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;she shall hear
my opinion, and not let that lad of hers kill himself by fretting.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s too good for that, if he had been an English lad, he would
have been off to his sweetheart long before this, without saying with
your leave or by your leave; but being a Frenchman, he is all for &AElig;neas
and filial piety,&mdash;filial fiddle-sticks!&rsquo;&nbsp; (My lord
had run away to sea, when a boy, against his father&rsquo;s consent,
I am sorry to say; and, as all had ended well, and he had come back
to find both his parents alive, I do not think he was ever as much aware
of his fault as he might have been under other circumstances.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, my lady,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t come with
me.&nbsp; A woman can manage a man best when he has a fit of obstinacy,
and a man can persuade a woman out of her tantrums, when all her own
sex, the whole army of them, would fail.&nbsp; Allow me to go alone
to my t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he said, what passed, he never could repeat; but he came
back graver than he went.&nbsp; However, the point was gained; Madame
de Cr&eacute;quy withdrew her prohibition, and had given him leave to
tell Cl&eacute;ment as much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But she is an old Cassandra,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let the lad be much with her; her talk would destroy
the courage of the bravest man; she is so given over to superstition.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Something that she had said had touched a chord in my lord&rsquo;s nature
which he inherited from his Scotch ancestors.&nbsp; Long afterwards,
I heard what this was.&nbsp; Medlicott told me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, my lord shook off all fancies that told against the
fulfilment of Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s wishes.&nbsp; All that afternoon
we three sat together, planning; and Monkshaven passed in and out, executing
our commissions, and preparing everything.&nbsp; Towards nightfall all
was ready for Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s start on his journey towards the
coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame had declined seeing any of us since my lord&rsquo;s
stormy interview with her.&nbsp; She sent word that she was fatigued,
and desired repose.&nbsp; But, of course, before Cl&eacute;ment set
off, he was bound to wish her farewell, and to ask for her blessing.&nbsp;
In order to avoid an agitating conversation between mother and son,
my lord and I resolved to be present at the interview.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment
was already in his travelling-dress, that of a Norman fisherman, which
Monkshaven had, with infinite trouble, discovered in the possession
of one of the emigr&eacute;s who thronged London, and who had made his
escape from the shores of France in this disguise.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s
plan was, to go down to the coast of Sussex, and get some of the fishing
or smuggling boats to take him across to the French coast near Dieppe.&nbsp;
There again he would have to change his dress.&nbsp; Oh, it was so well
planned!&nbsp; His mother was startled by his disguise (of which we
had not thought to forewarn her) as he entered her apartment.&nbsp;
And either that, or the being suddenly roused from the heavy slumber
into which she was apt to fall when she was left alone, gave her manner
an air of wildness that was almost like insanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go, go!&rsquo; she said to him, almost pushing him
away as he knelt to kiss her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Virginie is beckoning
to you, but you don&rsquo;t see what kind of a bed it is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cl&eacute;ment, make haste!&rsquo; said my lord, in
a hurried manner, as if to interrupt madame.&nbsp; &lsquo;The time is
later than I thought, and you must not miss the morning&rsquo;s tide.&nbsp;
Bid your mother good-bye at once, and let us be off.&rsquo;&nbsp; For
my lord and Monkshaven were to ride with him to an inn near the shore,
from whence he was to walk to his destination.&nbsp; My lord almost
took him by the arm to pull him away; and they were gone, and I was
left alone with Madame de Cr&eacute;quy.&nbsp; When she heard the horses&rsquo;
feet, she seemed to find out the truth, as if for the first time.&nbsp;
She set her teeth together.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has left me for her!&rsquo;
she almost screamed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Left me for her!&rsquo; she kept muttering;
and then, as the wild look came back into her eyes, she said, almost
with exultation, &lsquo;But I did not give him my blessing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;All night Madame de Cr&eacute;quy raved in delirium.&nbsp;
If I could I would have sent for Cl&eacute;ment back again.&nbsp; I
did send off one man, but I suppose my directions were confused, or
they were wrong, for he came back after my lord&rsquo;s return, on the
following afternoon.&nbsp; By this time Madame de Cr&eacute;quy was
quieter: she was, indeed, asleep from exhaustion when Lord Ludlow and
Monkshaven came in.&nbsp; They were in high spirits, and their hopefulness
brought me round to a less dispirited state.&nbsp; All had gone well:
they had accompanied Cl&eacute;ment on foot along the shore, until they
had met with a lugger, which my lord had hailed in good nautical language.&nbsp;
The captain had responded to these freemason terms by sending a boat
to pick up his passenger, and by an invitation to breakfast sent through
a speaking-trumpet.&nbsp; Monkshaven did not approve of either the meal
or the company, and had returned to the inn, but my lord had gone with
Cl&eacute;ment and breakfasted on board, upon grog, biscuit, fresh-caught
fish&mdash;&lsquo;the best breakfast he ever ate,&rsquo; he said, but
that was probably owing to the appetite his night&rsquo;s ride had given
him.&nbsp; However, his good fellowship had evidently won the captain&rsquo;s
heart, and Cl&eacute;ment had set sail under the best auspices.&nbsp;
It was agreed that I should tell all this to Madame de Cr&eacute;quy,
if she inquired; otherwise, it would be wiser not to renew her agitation
by alluding to her son&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat with her constantly for many days; but she never spoke
of Cl&eacute;ment.&nbsp; She forced herself to talk of the little occurrences
of Parisian society in former days: she tried to be conversational and
agreeable, and to betray no anxiety or even interest in the object of
Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s journey; and, as far as unremitting efforts could
go, she succeeded.&nbsp; But the tones of her voice were sharp and yet
piteous, as if she were in constant pain; and the glance of her eye
hurried and fearful, as if she dared not let it rest on any object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a week we heard of Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s safe arrival
on the French coast.&nbsp; He sent a letter to this effect by the captain
of the smuggler, when the latter returned.&nbsp; We hoped to hear again;
but week after week elapsed, and there was no news of Cl&eacute;ment.&nbsp;
I had told Lord Ludlow, in Madame de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s presence,
as he and I had arranged, of the note I had received from her son, informing
us of his landing in France.&nbsp; She heard, but she took no notice,
and evidently began to wonder that we did not mention any further intelligence
of him in the same manner before her; and daily I began to fear that
her pride would give way, and that she would supplicate for news before
I had any to give her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning, on my awakening, my maid told me that Madame
de Cr&eacute;quy had passed a wretched night, and had bidden Medlicott
(whom, as understanding French, and speaking it pretty well, though
with that horrid German accent, I had put about her) request that I
would go to madame&rsquo;s room as soon as I was dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what was coming, and I trembled all the time they were
doing my hair, and otherwise arranging me.&nbsp; I was not encouraged
by my lord&rsquo;s speeches.&nbsp; He had heard the message, and kept
declaring that he would rather be shot than have to tell her that there
was no news of her son; and yet he said, every now and then, when I
was at the lowest pitch of uneasiness, that he never expected to hear
again: that some day soon we should see him walking in and introducing
Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However at last I was ready, and go I must.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her eyes were fixed on the door by which I entered.&nbsp;
I went up to the bedside.&nbsp; She was not rouged,&mdash;she had left
it off now for several days,&mdash;she no longer attempted to keep up
the vain show of not feeling, and loving, and fearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a moment or two she did not speak, and I was glad of the
respite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cl&eacute;ment?&rsquo; she said at length, covering
her mouth with a handkerchief the minute she had spoken, that I might
not see it quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There has been no news since the first letter, saying
how well the voyage was performed, and how safely he had landed&mdash;near
Dieppe, you know,&rsquo; I replied as cheerfully as possible.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My lord does not expect that we shall have another letter; he
thinks that we shall see him soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no answer.&nbsp; As I looked, uncertain whether
to do or say more, she slowly turned herself in bed, and lay with her
face to the wall; and, as if that did not shut out the light of day
and the busy, happy world enough, she put out her trembling hands, and
covered her face with her handkerchief.&nbsp; There was no violence:
hardly any sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her what my lord had said about Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s
coming in some day, and taking us all by surprise.&nbsp; I did not believe
it myself, but it was just possible,&mdash;and I had nothing else to
say.&nbsp; Pity, to one who was striving so hard to conceal her feelings,
would have been impertinent.&nbsp; She let me talk; but she did not
reply.&nbsp; She knew that my words were vain and idle, and had no root
in my belief; as well as I did myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very thankful when Medlicott came in with Madame&rsquo;s
breakfast, and gave me an excuse for leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think that conversation made me feel more anxious and
impatient than ever.&nbsp; I felt almost pledged to Madame de Cr&eacute;quy
for the fulfilment of the vision I had held out.&nbsp; She had taken
entirely to her bed by this time: not from illness, but because she
had no hope within her to stir her up to the effort of dressing.&nbsp;
In the same way she hardly cared for food.&nbsp; She had no appetite,&mdash;why
eat to prolong a life of despair?&nbsp; But she let Medlicott feed her,
sooner than take the trouble of resisting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it went on,&mdash;for weeks, months&mdash;I could hardly
count the time, it seemed so long.&nbsp; Medlicott told me she noticed
a preternatural sensitiveness of ear in Madame de Cr&eacute;quy, induced
by the habit of listening silently for the slightest unusual sound in
the house.&nbsp; Medlicott was always a minute watcher of any one whom
she cared about; and, one day, she made me notice by a sign madame&rsquo;s
acuteness of hearing, although the quick expectation was but evinced
for a moment in the turn of the eye, the hushed breath&mdash;and then,
when the unusual footstep turned into my lord&rsquo;s apartments, the
soft quivering sigh, and the closed eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length the intendant of the De Cr&eacute;quy estates&mdash;the
old man, you will remember, whose information respecting Virginie de
Cr&eacute;quy first gave Cl&eacute;ment the desire to return to Paris,&mdash;came
to St. James&rsquo;s Square, and begged to speak to me.&nbsp; I made
haste to go down to him in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, sooner than
that he should be ushered into mine, for fear of madame hearing any
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man stood&mdash;I see him now&mdash;with his hat held
before him in both his hands; he slowly bowed till his face touched
it when I came in.&nbsp; Such long excess of courtesy augured ill.&nbsp;
He waited for me to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you any intelligence?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp;
He had been often to the house before, to ask if we had received any
news; and once or twice I had seen him, but this was the first time
he had begged to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, madame,&rsquo; he replied, still standing with
his head bent down, like a child in disgrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And it is bad!&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is bad.&rsquo;&nbsp; For a moment I was angry at
the cold tone in which my words were echoed; but directly afterwards
I saw the large, slow, heavy tears of age falling down the old man&rsquo;s
cheeks, and on to the sleeves of his poor, threadbare coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him how he had heard it: it seemed as though I could
not all at once bear to hear what it was.&nbsp; He told me that the
night before, in crossing Long Acre, he had stumbled upon an old acquaintance
of his; one who, like himself had been a dependent upon the De Cr&eacute;quy
family, but had managed their Paris affairs, while Fl&eacute;chier had
taken charge of their estates in the country.&nbsp; Both were now emigrants,
and living on the proceeds of such small available talents as they possessed.&nbsp;
Fl&eacute;chier, as I knew, earned a very fair livelihood by going about
to dress salads for dinner parties.&nbsp; His compatriot, Le F&egrave;bvre,
had begun to give a few lessons as a dancing-master.&nbsp; One of them
took the other home to his lodgings; and there, when their most immediate
personal adventures had been hastily talked over, came the inquiry from
Fl&eacute;chier as to Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cl&eacute;ment was dead&mdash;guillotined.&nbsp; Virginie
was dead&mdash;guillotined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Fl&eacute;chier had told me thus much, he could not speak
for sobbing; and I, myself, could hardly tell how to restrain my tears
sufficiently, until I could go to my own room and be at liberty to give
way.&nbsp; He asked my leave to bring in his friend Le F&egrave;bvre,
who was walking in the square, awaiting a possible summons to tell his
story.&nbsp; I heard afterwards a good many details, which filled up
the account, and made me feel&mdash;which brings me back to the point
I started from&mdash;how unfit the lower orders are for being trusted
indiscriminately with the dangerous powers of education.&nbsp; I have
made a long preamble, but now I am coming to the moral of my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady was trying to shake off the emotion which she evidently felt
in recurring to this sad history of Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; She came behind me, and arranged my pillows, and then,
seeing I had been crying&mdash;for, indeed, I was weak-spirited at the
time, and a little served to unloose my tears&mdash;she stooped down,
and kissed my forehead, and said &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; almost as
if she thanked me for feeling that old grief of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being once in France, it was no difficult thing for Cl&eacute;ment
to get into Paris.&nbsp; The difficulty in those days was to leave,
not to enter.&nbsp; He came in dressed as a Norman peasant, in charge
of a load of fruit and vegetables, with which one of the Seine barges
was freighted.&nbsp; He worked hard with his companions in landing and
arranging their produce on the quays; and then, when they dispersed
to get their breakfasts at some of the estaminets near the old March&eacute;
aux Fleurs, he sauntered up a street which conducted him, by many an
odd turn, through the Quartier Latin to a horrid back alley, leading
out of the Rue l&rsquo;Ecole de M&eacute;d&eacute;cine; some atrocious
place, as I have heard, not far from the shadow of that terrible Abbaye,
where so many of the best blood of France awaited their deaths.&nbsp;
But here some old man lived, on whose fidelity Cl&eacute;ment thought
that he might rely.&nbsp; I am not sure if he had not been gardener
in those very gardens behind the H&ocirc;tel Cr&eacute;quy where Cl&eacute;ment
and Urian used to play together years before.&nbsp; But whatever the
old man&rsquo;s dwelling might be, Cl&eacute;ment was only too glad
to reach it, you may be sure, he had been kept in Normandy, in all sorts
of disguises, for many days after landing in Dieppe, through the difficulty
of entering Paris unsuspected by the many ruffians who were always on
the look-out for aristocrats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gardener was, I believe, both faithful and tried,
and sheltered Cl&eacute;ment in his garret as well as might be.&nbsp;
Before he could stir out, it was necessary to procure a fresh disguise,
and one more in character with an inhabitant of Paris than that of a
Norman carter was procured; and after waiting in-doors for one or two
days, to see if any suspicion was excited, Cl&eacute;ment set off to
discover Virginie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He found her at the old conci&egrave;rge&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp;
Madame Babette was the name of this woman, who must have been a less
faithful&mdash;or rather, perhaps, I should say, a more interested&mdash;friend
to her guest than the old gardener Jaques was to Cl&eacute;ment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a miniature of Virginie, which a French lady of
quality happened to have in her possession at the time of her flight
from Paris, and which she brought with her to England unwittingly; for
it belonged to the Count de Cr&eacute;quy, with whom she was slightly
acquainted.&nbsp; I should fancy from it, that Virginie was taller and
of a more powerful figure for a woman than her cousin Cl&eacute;ment
was for a man.&nbsp; Her dark-brown hair was arranged in short curls&mdash;the
way of dressing the hair announced the politics of the individual, in
those days, just as patches did in my grandmother&rsquo;s time; and
Virginie&rsquo;s hair was not to my taste, or according to my principles:
it was too classical.&nbsp; Her large, black eyes looked out at you
steadily.&nbsp; One cannot judge of the shape of a nose from a full-face
miniature, but the nostrils were clearly cut and largely opened.&nbsp;
I do not fancy her nose could have been pretty; but her mouth had a
character all its own, and which would, I think, have redeemed a plainer
face.&nbsp; It was wide, and deep set into the cheeks at the corners;
the upper lip was very much arched, and hardly closed over the teeth;
so that the whole face looked (from the serious, intent look in the
eyes, and the sweet intelligence of the mouth) as if she were listening
eagerly to something to which her answer was quite ready, and would
come out of those red, opening lips as soon as ever you had done speaking,
and you longed to know what she would say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well: this Virginie de Cr&eacute;quy was living with Madame
Babette in the conci&egrave;rgerie of an old French inn, somewhere to
the north of Paris, so, far enough from Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s refuge.&nbsp;
The inn had been frequented by farmers from Brittany and such kind of
people, in the days when that sort of intercourse went on between Paris
and the provinces which had nearly stopped now.&nbsp; Few Bretons came
near it now, and the inn had fallen into the hands of Madame Babette&rsquo;s
brother, as payment for a bad wine debt of the last proprietor.&nbsp;
He put his sister and her child in, to keep it open, as it were, and
sent all the people he could to occupy the half-furnished rooms of the
house.&nbsp; They paid Babette for their lodging every morning as they
went out to breakfast, and returned or not as they chose, at night.&nbsp;
Every three days, the wine-merchant or his son came to Madame Babette,
and she accounted to them for the money she had received.&nbsp; She
and her child occupied the porter&rsquo;s office (in which the lad slept
at nights) and a little miserable bed-room which opened out of it, and
received all the light and air that was admitted through the door of
communication, which was half glass.&nbsp; Madame Babette must have
had a kind of attachment for the De Cr&eacute;quys&mdash;her De Cr&eacute;quys,
you understand&mdash;Virginie&rsquo;s father, the Count; for, at some
risk to herself, she had warned both him and his daughter of the danger
impending over them.&nbsp; But he, infatuated, would not believe that
his dear Human Race could ever do him harm; and, as long as he did not
fear, Virginie was not afraid.&nbsp; It was by some ruse, the nature
of which I never heard, that Madame Babette induced Virginie to come
to her abode at the very hour in which the Count had been recognized
in the streets, and hurried off to the Lanterne.&nbsp; It was after
Babette had got her there, safe shut up in the little back den, that
she told her what had befallen her father.&nbsp; From that day, Virginie
had never stirred out of the gates, or crossed the threshold of the
porter&rsquo;s lodge.&nbsp; I do not say that Madame Babette was tired
of her continual presence, or regretted the impulse which made her rush
to the De Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s well-known house&mdash;after being compelled
to form one of the mad crowds that saw the Count de Cr&eacute;quy seized
and hung&mdash;and hurry his daughter out, through alleys and backways,
until at length she had the orphan safe in her own dark sleeping-room,
and could tell her tale of horror: but Madame Babette was poorly paid
for her porter&rsquo;s work by her avaricious brother; and it was hard
enough to find food for herself and her growing boy; and, though the
poor girl ate little enough, I dare say, yet there seemed no end to
the burthen that Madame Babette had imposed upon herself: the De Cr&eacute;quys
were plundered, ruined, had become an extinct race, all but a lonely
friendless girl, in broken health and spirits; and, though she lent
no positive encouragement to his suit, yet, at the time, when Cl&eacute;ment
reappeared in Paris, Madame Babette was beginning to think that Virginie
might do worse than encourage the attentions of Monsieur Morin Fils,
her nephew, and the wine merchant&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Of course, he and
his father had the entr&eacute;e into the conci&egrave;rgerie of the
hotel that belonged to them, in right of being both proprietors and
relations.&nbsp; The son, Morin, had seen Virginie in this manner.&nbsp;
He was fully aware that she was far above him in rank, and guessed from
her whole aspect that she had lost her natural protectors by the terrible
guillotine; but he did not know her exact name or station, nor could
he persuade his aunt to tell him.&nbsp; However, he fell head over ears
in love with her, whether she were princess or peasant; and though at
first there was something about her which made his passionate love conceal
itself with shy, awkward reserve, and then made it only appear in the
guise of deep, respectful devotion; yet, by-and-by,&mdash;by the same
process of reasoning, I suppose, that his aunt had gone through even
before him&mdash;Jean Morin began to let Hope oust Despair from his
heart.&nbsp; Sometimes he thought&mdash;perhaps years hence&mdash;that
solitary, friendless lady, pent up in squalor, might turn to him as
to a friend and comforter&mdash;and then&mdash;and then&mdash;.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Jean Morin was most attentive to his aunt, whom he had rather
slighted before.&nbsp; He would linger over the accounts; would bring
her little presents; and, above all, he made a pet and favourite of
Pierre, the little cousin, who could tell him about all the ways of
going on of Mam&rsquo;selle Cannes, as Virginie was called.&nbsp; Pierre
was thoroughly aware of the drift and cause of his cousin&rsquo;s inquiries;
and was his ardent partisan, as I have heard, even before Jean Morin
had exactly acknowledged his wishes to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have required some patience and much diplomacy, before
Cl&eacute;ment de Cr&eacute;quy found out the exact place where his
cousin was hidden.&nbsp; The old gardener took the cause very much to
heart; as, judging from my recollections, I imagine he would have forwarded
any fancy, however wild, of Monsieur Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s.&nbsp; (I
will tell you afterwards how I came to know all these particulars so
well.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s return, on two succeeding days,
from his dangerous search, without meeting with any good result, Jacques
entreated Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy to let him take it in hand.&nbsp;
He represented that he, as gardener for the space of twenty years and
more at the H&ocirc;tel de Cr&eacute;quy, had a right to be acquainted
with all the successive conci&egrave;rges at the Count&rsquo;s house;
that he should not go among them as a stranger, but as an old friend,
anxious to renew pleasant intercourse; and that if the Intendant&rsquo;s
story, which he had told Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy in England, was true,
that mademoiselle was in hiding at the house of a former conci&egrave;rge,
why, something relating to her would surely drop out in the course of
conversation.&nbsp; So he persuaded Cl&eacute;ment to remain indoors,
while he set off on his round, with no apparent object but to gossip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night he came home,&mdash;having seen mademoiselle.&nbsp;
He told Cl&eacute;ment much of the story relating to Madame Babette
that I have told to you.&nbsp; Of course, he had heard nothing of the
ambitious hopes of Morin Fils,&mdash;hardly of his existence, I should
think.&nbsp; Madame Babette had received him kindly; although, for some
time, she had kept him standing in the carriage gateway outside her
door.&nbsp; But, on his complaining of the draught and his rheumatism,
she had asked him in: first looking round with some anxiety, to see
who was in the room behind her.&nbsp; No one was there when he entered
and sat down.&nbsp; But, in a minute or two, a tall, thin young lady,
with great, sad eyes, and pale cheeks, came from the inner room, and,
seeing him, retired.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is Mademoiselle Cannes,&rsquo;
said Madame Babette, rather unnecessarily; for, if he had not been on
the watch for some sign of Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy, he would hardly
have noticed the entrance and withdrawal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cl&eacute;ment and the good old gardener were always rather
perplexed by Madame Babette&rsquo;s evident avoidance of all mention
of the De Cr&eacute;quy family.&nbsp; If she were so much interested
in one member as to be willing to undergo the pains and penalties of
a domiciliary visit, it was strange that she never inquired after the
existence of her charge&rsquo;s friends and relations from one who might
very probably have heard something of them.&nbsp; They settled that
Madame Babette must believe that the Marquise and Cl&eacute;ment were
dead; and admired her for her reticence in never speaking of Virginie.&nbsp;
The truth was, I suspect, that she was so desirous of her nephews success
by this time, that she did not like letting any one into the secret
of Virginie&rsquo;s whereabouts who might interfere with their plan.&nbsp;
However, it was arranged between Cl&eacute;ment and his humble friend,
that the former, dressed in the peasant&rsquo;s clothes in which he
had entered Paris, but smartened up in one or two particulars, as if,
although a countryman, he had money to spare, should go and engage a
sleeping-room in the old Br&eacute;ton Inn; where, as I told you, accommodation
for the night was to be had.&nbsp; This was accordingly done, without
exciting Madame Babette&rsquo;s suspicions, for she was unacquainted
with the Normandy accent, and consequently did not perceive the exaggeration
of it which Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy adopted in order to disguise his
pure Parisian.&nbsp; But after he had for two nights slept in a queer
dark closet, at the end of one of the numerous short galleries in the
H&ocirc;tel Duguesclin, and paid his money for such accommodation each
morning at the little bureau under the window of the conci&egrave;rgerie,
he found himself no nearer to his object.&nbsp; He stood outside in
the gateway: Madame Babette opened a pane in her window, counted out
the change, gave polite thanks, and shut to the pane with a clack, before
he could ever find out what to say that might be the means of opening
a conversation.&nbsp; Once in the streets, he was in danger from the
bloodthirsty mob, who were ready in those days to hunt to death every
one who looked like a gentleman, as an aristocrat: and Cl&eacute;ment,
depend upon it, looked a gentleman, whatever dress he wore.&nbsp; Yet
it was unwise to traverse Paris to his old friend the gardener&rsquo;s
gr&eacute;nier, so he had to loiter about, where I hardly know.&nbsp;
Only he did leave the H&ocirc;tel Duguesclin, and he did not go to old
Jacques, and there was not another house in Paris open to him.&nbsp;
At the end of two days, he had made out Pierre&rsquo;s existence; and
he began to try to make friends with the lad.&nbsp; Pierre was too sharp
and shrewd not to suspect something from the confused attempts at friendliness.&nbsp;
It was not for nothing that the Norman farmer lounged in the court and
doorway, and brought home presents of galette.&nbsp; Pierre accepted
the galette, reciprocated the civil speeches, but kept his eyes open.&nbsp;
Once, returning home pretty late at night, he surprised the Norman studying
the shadows on the blind, which was drawn down when Madame Babette&rsquo;s
lamp was lighted.&nbsp; On going in, he found Mademoiselle Cannes with
his mother, sitting by the table, and helping in the family mending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre was afraid that the Norman had some view upon the money
which his mother, as conci&egrave;rge, collected for her brother.&nbsp;
But the money was all safe next evening, when his cousin, Monsieur Morin
Fils, came to collect it.&nbsp; Madame Babette asked her nephew to sit
down, and skilfully barred the passage to the inner door, so that Virginie,
had she been ever so much disposed, could not have retreated.&nbsp;
She sat silently sewing.&nbsp; All at once the little party were startled
by a very sweet tenor voice, just close to the street window, singing
one of the airs out of Beaumarchais&rsquo; operas, which, a few years
before, had been popular all over Paris.&nbsp; But after a few moments
of silence, and one or two remarks, the talking went on again.&nbsp;
Pierre, however, noticed an increased air of abstraction in Virginie,
who, I suppose, was recurring to the last time that she had heard the
song, and did not consider, as her cousin had hoped she would have done,
what were the words set to the air, which he imagined she would remember,
and which would have told her so much.&nbsp; For, only a few years before,
Adam&rsquo;s opera of Richard le Roi had made the story of the minstrel
Blondel and our English Coeur de Lion familiar to all the opera-going
part of the Parisian public, and Cl&eacute;ment had bethought him of
establishing a communication with Virginie by some such means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next night, about the same hour, the same voice was singing
outside the window again.&nbsp; Pierre, who had been irritated by the
proceeding the evening before, as it had diverted Virginie&rsquo;s attention
from his cousin, who had been doing his utmost to make himself agreeable,
rushed out to the door, just as the Norman was ringing the bell to be
admitted for the night.&nbsp; Pierre looked up and down the street;
no one else was to be seen.&nbsp; The next day, the Norman mollified
him somewhat by knocking at the door of the conci&egrave;rgerie, and
begging Monsieur Pierre&rsquo;s acceptance of some knee-buckles, which
had taken the country farmer&rsquo;s fancy the day before, as he had
been gazing into the shops, but which, being too small for his purpose,
he took the liberty of offering to Monsieur Pierre.&nbsp; Pierre, a
French boy, inclined to foppery, was charmed, ravished by the beauty
of the present and with monsieur&rsquo;s goodness, and he began to adjust
them to his breeches immediately, as well as he could, at least, in
his mother&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; The Norman, whom Pierre kept carefully
on the outside of the threshold, stood by, as if amused at the boy&rsquo;s
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take care,&rsquo; said he, clearly and distinctly;
&lsquo;take care, my little friend, lest you become a fop; and, in that
case, some day, years hence, when your heart is devoted to some young
lady, she may be inclined to say to you&rsquo;&mdash;here he raised
his voice&mdash;&lsquo;No, thank you; when I marry, I marry a man, not
a petit-ma&icirc;tre; I marry a man, who, whatever his position may
be, will add dignity to the human race by his virtues.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Farther than that in his quotation Cl&eacute;ment dared not go.&nbsp;
His sentiments (so much above the apparent occasion) met with applause
from Pierre, who liked to contemplate himself in the light of a lover,
even though it should be a rejected one, and who hailed the mention
of the words &lsquo;virtues&rsquo; and &lsquo;dignity of the human race&rsquo;
as belonging to the cant of a good citizen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Cl&eacute;ment was more anxious to know how the invisible
Lady took his speech.&nbsp; There was no sign at the time.&nbsp; But
when he returned at night, he heard a voice, low singing, behind Madame
Babette, as she handed him his candle, the very air he had sung without
effect for two nights past.&nbsp; As if he had caught it up from her
murmuring voice, he sang it loudly and clearly as he crossed the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here is our opera-singer!&rsquo; exclaimed Madame Babette.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, the Norman grazier sings like Boupr&eacute;,&rsquo; naming
a favourite singer at the neighbouring theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre was struck by the remark, and quietly resolved to look
after the Norman; but again, I believe, it was more because of his mother&rsquo;s
deposit of money than with any thought of Virginie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the next morning, to the wonder of both mother and
son, Mademoiselle Cannes proposed, with much hesitation, to go out and
make some little purchase for herself.&nbsp; A month or two ago, this
was what Madame Babette had been never weary of urging.&nbsp; But now
she was as much surprised as if she had expected Virginie to remain
a prisoner in her rooms all the rest of her life.&nbsp; I suppose she
had hoped that her first time of quitting it would be when she left
it for Monsieur Morin&rsquo;s house as his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quick look from Madame Babette towards Pierre was all that
was needed to encourage the boy to follow her.&nbsp; He went out cautiously.&nbsp;
She was at the end of the street.&nbsp; She looked up and down, as if
waiting for some one.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; Back she came, so
swiftly that she nearly caught Pierre before he could retreat through
the porte-coch&egrave;re.&nbsp; There he looked out again.&nbsp; The
neighbourhood was low and wild, and strange; and some one spoke to Virginie,&mdash;nay,
laid his hand upon her arm,&mdash;whose dress and aspect (he had emerged
out of a side-street) Pierre did not know; but, after a start, and (Pierre
could fancy) a little scream, Virginie recognised the stranger, and
the two turned up the side street whence the man had come.&nbsp; Pierre
stole swiftly to the corner of this street; no one was there: they had
disappeared up some of the alleys.&nbsp; Pierre returned home to excite
his mother&rsquo;s infinite surprise.&nbsp; But they had hardly done
talking, when Virginie returned, with a colour and a radiance in her
face, which they had never seen there since her father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you that I heard much of this story from a friend
of the Intendant of the De Cr&eacute;quys, whom he met with in London.&nbsp;
Some years afterwards&mdash;the summer before my lord&rsquo;s death&mdash;I
was travelling with him in Devonshire, and we went to see the French
prisoners of war on Dartmoor.&nbsp; We fell into conversation with one
of them, whom I found out to be the very Pierre of whom I had heard
before, as having been involved in the fatal story of Cl&eacute;ment
and Virginie, and by him I was told much of their last days, and thus
I learnt how to have some sympathy with all those who were concerned
in those terrible events; yes, even with the younger Morin himself,
on whose behalf Pierre spoke warmly, even after so long a time had elapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For when the younger Morin called at the porter&rsquo;s lodge,
on the evening of the day when Virginie had gone out for the first time
after so many months&rsquo; confinement to the conci&egrave;rgerie,
he was struck with the improvement in her appearance.&nbsp; It seems
to have hardly been that he thought her beauty greater: for, in addition
to the fact that she was not beautiful, Morin had arrived at that point
of being enamoured when it does not signify whether the beloved one
is plain or handsome&mdash;she has enchanted one pair of eyes, which
henceforward see her through their own medium.&nbsp; But Morin noticed
the faint increase of colour and light in her countenance.&nbsp; It
was as though she had broken through her thick cloud of hopeless sorrow,
and was dawning forth into a happier life.&nbsp; And so, whereas during
her grief, he had revered and respected it even to a point of silent
sympathy, now that she was gladdened, his heart rose on the wings of
strengthened hopes.&nbsp; Even in the dreary monotony of this existence
in his Aunt Babette&rsquo;s conci&egrave;rgerie, Time had not failed
in his work, and now, perhaps, soon he might humbly strive to help Time.&nbsp;
The very next day he returned&mdash;on some pretence of business&mdash;to
the H&ocirc;tel Duguesclin, and made his aunt&rsquo;s room, rather than
his aunt herself, a present of roses and geraniums tied up in a bouquet
with a tricolor ribbon.&nbsp; Virginie was in the room, sitting at the
coarse sewing she liked to do for Madame Babette.&nbsp; He saw her eyes
brighten at the sight of the flowers: she asked his aunt to let her
arrange them; he saw her untie the ribbon, and with a gesture of dislike,
throw it on the ground, and give it a kick with her little foot, and
even in this girlish manner of insulting his dearest prejudices, he
found something to admire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he was coming out, Pierre stopped him.&nbsp; The lad had
been trying to arrest his cousin&rsquo;s attention by futile grimaces
and signs played off behind Virginie&rsquo;s back: but Monsieur Morin
saw nothing but Mademoiselle Cannes.&nbsp; However, Pierre was not to
be baffled, and Monsieur Morin found him in waiting just outside the
threshold.&nbsp; With his finger on his lips, Pierre walked on tiptoe
by his companion&rsquo;s side till they would have been long past sight
or hearing of the conci&egrave;rgerie, even had the inhabitants devoted
themselves to the purposes of spying or listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chut!&rsquo; said Pierre, at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
goes out walking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Monsieur Morin, half curious, half
annoyed at being disturbed in the delicious reverie of the future into
which he longed to fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; It is not well.&nbsp; It is bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why? I do not ask who she is, but I have my ideas.&nbsp;
She is an aristocrat.&nbsp; Do the people about here begin to suspect
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said Pierre.&nbsp; &lsquo;But she goes
out walking.&nbsp; She has gone these two mornings.&nbsp; I have watched
her.&nbsp; She meets a man&mdash;she is friends with him, for she talks
to him as eagerly as he does to her&mdash;mamma cannot tell who he is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Has my aunt seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, not so much as a fly&rsquo;s wing of him.&nbsp;
I myself have only seen his back.&nbsp; It strikes me like a familiar
back, and yet I cannot think who it is.&nbsp; But they separate with
sudden darts, like two birds who have been together to feed their young
ones.&nbsp; One moment they are in close talk, their heads together
chuckotting; the next he has turned up some bye-street, and Mademoiselle
Cannes is close upon me&mdash;has almost caught me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But she did not see you?&rsquo; inquired Monsieur Morin,
in so altered a voice that Pierre gave him one of his quick penetrating
looks.&nbsp; He was struck by the way in which his cousin&rsquo;s features&mdash;always
coarse and common-place&mdash;had become contracted and pinched; struck,
too, by the livid look on his sallow complexion.&nbsp; But as if Morin
was conscious of the manner in which his face belied his feelings, he
made an effort, and smiled, and patted Pierre&rsquo;s head, and thanked
him for his intelligence, and gave him a five-franc piece, and bade
him go on with his observations of Mademoiselle Cannes&rsquo; movements,
and report all to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre returned home with a light heart, tossing up his five-franc
piece as he ran.&nbsp; Just as he was at the conci&egrave;rgerie door,
a great tall man bustled past him, and snatched his money away from
him, looking back with a laugh, which added insult to injury.&nbsp;
Pierre had no redress; no one had witnessed the impudent theft, and
if they had, no one to be seen in the street was strong enough to give
him redress.&nbsp; Besides, Pierre had seen enough of the state of the
streets of Paris at that time to know that friends, not enemies, were
required, and the man had a bad air about him.&nbsp; But all these considerations
did not keep Pierre from bursting out into a fit of crying when he was
once more under his mother&rsquo;s roof; and Virginie, who was alone
there (Madame Babette having gone out to make her daily purchases),
might have imagined him pommeled to death by the loudness of his sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Speak,
my child.&nbsp; What hast thou done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He has robbed me! he has robbed me!&rsquo; was all
Pierre could gulp out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Robbed thee! and of what, my poor boy?&rsquo; said
Virginie, stroking his hair gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of my five-franc piece&mdash;of a five-franc piece,&rsquo;
said Pierre, correcting himself, and leaving out the word my, half fearful
lest Virginie should inquire how he became possessed of such a sum,
and for what services it had been given him.&nbsp; But, of course, no
such idea came into her head, for it would have been impertinent, and
she was gentle-born.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a moment, my lad,&rsquo; and going to the one
small drawer in the inner apartment, which held all her few possessions,
she brought back a little ring&mdash;a ring just with one ruby in it&mdash;which
she had worn in the days when she cared to wear jewels.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take
this,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and run with it to a jeweller&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
It is but a poor, valueless thing, but it will bring you in your five
francs, at any rate.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; I desire you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I cannot,&rsquo; said the boy, hesitating; some
dim sense of honour flitting through his misty morals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, you must!&rsquo; she continued, urging him with
her hand to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Run! if it brings in more than five
francs, you shall return the surplus to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus tempted by her urgency, and, I suppose, reasoning with
himself to the effect that he might as well have the money, and then
see whether he thought it right to act as a spy upon her or not&mdash;the
one action did not pledge him to the other, nor yet did she make any
conditions with her gift&mdash;Pierre went off with her ring; and, after
repaying himself his five francs, he was enabled to bring Virginie back
two more, so well had he managed his affairs.&nbsp; But, although the
whole transaction did not leave him bound, in any way, to discover or
forward Virginie&rsquo;s wishes, it did leave him pledged, according
to his code, to act according to her advantage, and he considered himself
the judge of the best course to be pursued to this end.&nbsp; And, moreover,
this little kindness attached him to her personally.&nbsp; He began
to think how pleasant it would be to have so kind and generous a person
for a relation; how easily his troubles might be borne if he had always
such a ready helper at hand; how much he should like to make her like
him, and come to him for the protection of his masculine power!&nbsp;
First of all his duties, as her self-appointed squire, came the necessity
of finding out who her strange new acquaintance was.&nbsp; Thus, you
see, he arrived at the same end, via supposed duty, that he was previously
pledged to via interest.&nbsp; I fancy a good number of us, when any
line of action will promote our own interest, can make ourselves believe
that reasons exist which compel us to it as a duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the course of a very few days, Pierre had so circumvented
Virginie as to have discovered that her new friend was no other than
the Norman farmer in a different dress.&nbsp; This was a great piece
of knowledge to impart to Morin.&nbsp; But Pierre was not prepared for
the immediate physical effect it had on his cousin.&nbsp; Morin sat
suddenly down on one of the seats in the Boulevards&mdash;it was there
Pierre had met with him accidentally&mdash;when he heard who it was
that Virginie met.&nbsp; I do not suppose the man had the faintest idea
of any relationship or even previous acquaintanceship between Cl&eacute;ment
and Virginie.&nbsp; If he thought of anything beyond the mere fact presented
to him, that his idol was in communication with another, younger, handsomer
man than himself, it must have been that the Norman farmer had seen
her at the conci&egrave;rgerie, and had been attracted by her, and,
as was but natural, had tried to make her acquaintance, and had succeeded.&nbsp;
But, from what Pierre told me, I should not think that even this much
thought passed through Morin&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; He seems to have been
a man of rare and concentrated attachments; violent, though restrained
and undemonstrative passions; and, above all, a capability of jealousy,
of which his dark oriental complexion must have been a type.&nbsp; I
could fancy that if he had married Virginie, he would have coined his
life-blood for luxuries to make her happy; would have watched over and
petted her, at every sacrifice to himself, as long as she would have
been content to live with him alone.&nbsp; But, as Pierre expressed
it to me: &lsquo;When I saw what my cousin was, when I learned his nature
too late, I perceived that he would have strangled a bird if she whom
he loved was attracted by it from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Pierre had told Morin of his discovery, Morin sat down,
as I said, quite suddenly, as if he had been shot.&nbsp; He found out
that the first meeting between the Norman and Virginie was no accidental,
isolated circumstance.&nbsp; Pierre was torturing him with his accounts
of daily rendezvous: if but for a moment, they were seeing each other
every day, sometimes twice a day.&nbsp; And Virginie could speak to
this man, though to himself she was coy and reserved as hardly to utter
a sentence.&nbsp; Pierre caught these broken words while his cousin&rsquo;s
complexion grew more and more livid, and then purple, as if some great
effect were produced on his circulation by the news he had just heard.&nbsp;
Pierre was so startled by his cousin&rsquo;s wandering, senseless eyes,
and otherwise disordered looks, that he rushed into a neighbouring cabaret
for a glass of absinthe, which he paid for, as he recollected afterwards,
with a portion of Virginie&rsquo;s five francs.&nbsp; By-and-by Morin
recovered his natural appearance; but he was gloomy and silent; and
all that Pierre could get out of him was, that the Norman farmer should
not sleep another night at the H&ocirc;tel Duguesclin, giving him such
opportunities of passing and repassing by the conci&egrave;rgerie door.&nbsp;
He was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to repay Pierre the half
franc he had spent on the absinthe, which Pierre perceived, and seems
to have noted down in the ledger of his mind as on Virginie&rsquo;s
balance of favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether, he was much disappointed at his cousin&rsquo;s
mode of receiving intelligence, which the lad thought worth another
five-franc piece at least; or, if not paid for in money, to be paid
for in open-mouthed confidence and expression of feeling, that he was,
for a time, so far a partisan of Virginie&rsquo;s&mdash;unconscious
Virginie&mdash;against his cousin, as to feel regret when the Norman
returned no more to his night&rsquo;s lodging, and when Virginie&rsquo;s
eager watch at the crevice of the closely-drawn blind ended only with
a sigh of disappointment.&nbsp; If it had not been for his mother&rsquo;s
presence at the time, Pierre thought he should have told her all.&nbsp;
But how far was his mother in his cousin&rsquo;s confidence as regarded
the dismissal of the Norman?</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few days, however, Pierre felt almost sure that they
had established some new means of communication.&nbsp; Virginie went
out for a short time every day; but though Pierre followed her as closely
as he could without exciting her observation, he was unable to discover
what kind of intercourse she held with the Norman.&nbsp; She went, in
general, the same short round among the little shops in the neighbourhood;
not entering any, but stopping at two or three.&nbsp; Pierre afterwards
remembered that she had invariably paused at the nosegays displayed
in a certain window, and studied them long: but, then, she stopped and
looked at caps, hats, fashions, confectionery (all of the humble kind
common in that quarter), so how should he have known that any particular
attraction existed among the flowers?&nbsp; Morin came more regularly
than ever to his aunt&rsquo;s; but Virginie was apparently unconscious
that she was the attraction.&nbsp; She looked healthier and more hopeful
than she had done for months, and her manners to all were gentler and
not so reserved.&nbsp; Almost as if she wished to manifest her gratitude
to Madame Babette for her long continuance of kindness, the necessity
for which was nearly ended, Virginie showed an unusual alacrity in rendering
the old woman any little service in her power, and evidently tried to
respond to Monsieur Morin&rsquo;s civilities, he being Madame Babette&rsquo;s
nephew, with a soft graciousness which must have made one of her principal
charms; for all who knew her speak of the fascination of her manners,
so winning and attentive to others, while yet her opinions, and often
her actions, were of so decided a character.&nbsp; For, as I have said,
her beauty was by no means great; yet every man who came near her seems
to have fallen into the sphere of her influence.&nbsp; Monsieur Morin
was deeper than ever in love with her during these last few days: he
was worked up into a state capable of any sacrifice, either of himself
or others, so that he might obtain her at last.&nbsp; He sat &lsquo;devouring
her with his eyes&rsquo; (to use Pierre&rsquo;s expression) whenever
she could not see him; but, if she looked towards him, he looked to
the ground&mdash;anywhere&mdash;away from her and almost stammered in
his replies if she addressed any question to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been, I should think, ashamed of his extreme agitation
on the Boulevards, for Pierre thought that he absolutely shunned him
for these few succeeding days.&nbsp; He must have believed that he had
driven the Norman (my poor Cl&eacute;ment!) off the field, by banishing
him from his inn; and thought that the intercourse between him and Virginie,
which he had thus interrupted, was of so slight and transient a character
as to be quenched by a little difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he appears to have felt that he had made but little way,
and he awkwardly turned to Pierre for help&mdash;not yet confessing
his love, though; he only tried to make friends again with the lad after
their silent estrangement.&nbsp; And Pierre for some time did not choose
to perceive his cousin&rsquo;s advances.&nbsp; He would reply to all
the roundabout questions Morin put to him respecting household conversations
when he was not present, or household occupations and tone of thought,
without mentioning Virginie&rsquo;s name any more than his questioner
did.&nbsp; The lad would seem to suppose, that his cousin&rsquo;s strong
interest in their domestic ways of going on was all on account of Madame
Babette.&nbsp; At last he worked his cousin up to the point of making
him a confidant: and then the boy was half frightened at the torrent
of vehement words he had unloosed.&nbsp; The lava came down with a greater
rush for having been pent up so long.&nbsp; Morin cried out his words
in a hoarse, passionate voice, clenched his teeth, his fingers, and
seemed almost convulsed, as he spoke out his terrible love for Virginie,
which would lead him to kill her sooner than see her another&rsquo;s;
and if another stepped in between him and her!&mdash;and then he smiled
a fierce, triumphant smile, but did not say any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre was, as I said, half-frightened; but also half-admiring.&nbsp;
This was really love&mdash;a &lsquo;grande passion,&rsquo;&mdash;a really
fine dramatic thing,&mdash;like the plays they acted at the little theatre
yonder.&nbsp; He had a dozen times the sympathy with his cousin now
that he had had before, and readily swore by the infernal gods, for
they were far too enlightened to believe in one God, or Christianity,
or anything of the kind,&mdash;that he would devote himself, body and
soul, to forwarding his cousin&rsquo;s views.&nbsp; Then his cousin
took him to a shop, and bought him a smart second-hand watch, on which
they scratched the word Fid&eacute;lit&eacute;, and thus was the compact
sealed.&nbsp; Pierre settled in his own mind, that if he were a woman,
he should like to be beloved as Virginie was, by his cousin, and that
it would be an extremely good thing for her to be the wife of so rich
a citizen as Morin Fils,&mdash;and for Pierre himself, too, for doubtless
their gratitude would lead them to give him rings and watches ad infinitum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A day or two afterwards, Virginie was taken ill.&nbsp; Madame
Babette said it was because she had persevered in going out in all weathers,
after confining herself to two warm rooms for so long; and very probably
this was really the cause, for, from Pierre&rsquo;s account, she must
have been suffering from a feverish cold, aggravated, no doubt, by her
impatience at Madame Babette&rsquo;s familiar prohibitions of any more
walks until she was better.&nbsp; Every day, in spite of her trembling,
aching limbs, she would fain have arranged her dress for her walk at
the usual time; but Madame Babette was fully prepared to put physical
obstacles in her way, if she was not obedient in remaining tranquil
on the little sofa by the side of the fire.&nbsp; The third day, she
called Pierre to her, when his mother was not attending (having, in
fact, locked up Mademoiselle Cannes&rsquo; out-of-door things).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See, my child,&rsquo; said Virginie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
must do me a great favour.&nbsp; Go to the gardener&rsquo;s shop in
the Rue des Bons-Enfans, and look at the nosegays in the window.&nbsp;
I long for pinks; they are my favourite flower.&nbsp; Here are two francs.&nbsp;
If thou seest a nosegay of pinks displayed in the window, if it be ever
so faded&mdash;nay, if thou seest two or three nosegays of pinks, remember,
buy them all, and bring them to me, I have so great a desire for the
smell.&rsquo;&nbsp; She fell back weak and exhausted.&nbsp; Pierre hurried
out.&nbsp; Now was the time; here was the clue to the long inspection
of the nosegay in this very shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, there was a drooping nosegay of pinks in the
window.&nbsp; Pierre went in, and, with all his impatience, he made
as good a bargain as he could, urging that the flowers were faded, and
good for nothing.&nbsp; At last he purchased them at a very moderate
price.&nbsp; And now you will learn the bad consequences of teaching
the lower orders anything beyond what is immediately necessary to enable
them to earn their daily bread!&nbsp; The silly Count de Cr&eacute;quy,&mdash;he
who had been sent to his bloody rest, by the very canaille of whom he
thought so much,&mdash;he who had made Virginie (indirectly, it is true)
reject such a man as her cousin Cl&eacute;ment, by inflating her mind
with his bubbles of theories,&mdash;this Count de Cr&eacute;quy had
long ago taken a fancy to Pierre, as he saw the bright sharp child playing
about his court&mdash;Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy had even begun to educate
the boy himself to try work out certain opinions of his into practice,&mdash;but
the drudgery of the affair wearied him, and, beside, Babette had left
his employment.&nbsp; Still the Count took a kind of interest in his
former pupil; and made some sort of arrangement by which Pierre was
to be taught reading and writing, and accounts, and Heaven knows what
besides,&mdash;Latin, I dare say.&nbsp; So Pierre, instead of being
an innocent messenger, as he ought to have been&mdash;(as Mr. Horner&rsquo;s
little lad Gregson ought to have been this morning)&mdash;could read
writing as well as either you or I.&nbsp; So what does he do, on obtaining
the nosegay, but examine it well.&nbsp; The stalks of the flowers were
tied up with slips of matting in wet moss.&nbsp; Pierre undid the strings,
unwrapped the moss, and out fell a piece of wet paper, with the writing
all blurred with moisture.&nbsp; It was but a torn piece of writing-paper,
apparently, but Pierre&rsquo;s wicked mischievous eyes read what was
written on it,&mdash;written so as to look like a fragment,&mdash;&lsquo;Ready,
every and any night at nine.&nbsp; All is prepared.&nbsp; Have no fright.&nbsp;
Trust one who, whatever hopes he might once have had, is content now
to serve you as a faithful cousin;&rsquo; and a place was named, which
I forget, but which Pierre did not, as it was evidently the rendezvous.&nbsp;
After the lad had studied every word, till he could say it off by heart,
he placed the paper where he had found it, enveloped it in moss, and
tied the whole up again carefully.&nbsp; Virginie&rsquo;s face coloured
scarlet as she received it.&nbsp; She kept smelling at it, and trembling:
but she did not untie it, although Pierre suggested how much fresher
it would be if the stalks were immediately put into water.&nbsp; But
once, after his back had been turned for a minute, he saw it untied
when he looked round again, and Virginie was blushing, and hiding something
in her bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre was now all impatience to set off and find his cousin,
But his mother seemed to want him for small domestic purposes even more
than usual; and he had chafed over a multitude of errands connected
with the H&ocirc;tel before he could set off and search for his cousin
at his usual haunts.&nbsp; At last the two met and Pierre related all
the events of the morning to Morin.&nbsp; He said the note off word
by word.&nbsp; (That lad this morning had something of the magpie look
of Pierre&mdash;it made me shudder to see him, and hear him repeat the
note by heart.)&nbsp; Then Morin asked him to tell him all over again.&nbsp;
Pierre was struck by Morin&rsquo;s heavy sighs as he repeated the story.&nbsp;
When he came the second time to the note, Morin tried to write the words
down; but either he was not a good, ready scholar, or his fingers trembled
too much.&nbsp; Pierre hardly remembered, but, at any rate, the lad
had to do it, with his wicked reading and writing.&nbsp; When this was
done, Morin sat heavily silent.&nbsp; Pierre would have preferred the
expected outburst, for this impenetrable gloom perplexed and baffled
him.&nbsp; He had even to speak to his cousin to rouse him; and when
he replied, what he said had so little apparent connection with the
subject which Pierre had expected to find uppermost in his mind, that
he was half afraid that his cousin had lost his wits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My Aunt Babette is out of coffee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure I do not know,&rsquo; said Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, she is.&nbsp; I heard her say so.&nbsp; Tell her
that a friend of mine has just opened a shop in the Rue Saint Antoine,
and that if she will join me there in an hour, I will supply her with
a good stock of coffee, just to give my friend encouragement.&nbsp;
His name is Antoine Meyer, Number One hundred and Fifty at the sign
of the Cap of Liberty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I could go with you now.&nbsp; I can carry a few pounds
of coffee better than my mother,&rsquo; said Pierre, all in good faith.&nbsp;
He told me he should never forget the look on his cousin&rsquo;s face,
as he turned round, and bade him begone, and give his mother the message
without another word.&nbsp; It had evidently sent him home promptly
to obey his cousins command.&nbsp; Morin&rsquo;s message perplexed Madame
Babette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How could he know I was out of coffee?&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am; but I only used the last up this morning.&nbsp;
How could Victor know about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure I can&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; said Pierre, who
by this time had recovered his usual self-possession.&nbsp; &lsquo;All
I know is, that monsieur is in a pretty temper, and that if you are
not sharp to your time at this Antoine Meyer&rsquo;s you are likely
to come in for some of his black looks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it is very kind of him to offer to give me some
coffee, to be sure!&nbsp; But how could he know I was out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre hurried his mother off impatiently, for he was certain
that the offer of the coffee was only a blind to some hidden purpose
on his cousin&rsquo;s part; and he made no doubt that when his mother
had been informed of what his cousin&rsquo;s real intention was, he,
Pierre, could extract it from her by coaxing or bullying.&nbsp; But
he was mistaken.&nbsp; Madame Babette returned home, grave, depressed,
silent, and loaded with the best coffee.&nbsp; Some time afterwards
he learnt why his cousin had sought for this interview.&nbsp; It was
to extract from her, by promises and threats, the real name of Mam&rsquo;selle
Cannes, which would give him a clue to the true appellation of The Faithful
Cousin.&nbsp; He concealed the second purpose from his aunt, who had
been quite unaware of his jealousy of the Norman farmer, or of his identification
of him with any relation of Virginie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But Madame Babette
instinctively shrank from giving him any information: she must have
felt that, in the lowering mood in which she found him, his desire for
greater knowledge of Virginie&rsquo;s antecedents boded her no good.&nbsp;
And yet he made his aunt his confidante&mdash;told her what she had
only suspected before&mdash;that he was deeply enamoured of Mam&rsquo;selle
Cannes, and would gladly marry her.&nbsp; He spoke to Madame Babette
of his father&rsquo;s hoarded riches; and of the share which he, as
partner, had in them at the present time; and of the prospect of the
succession to the whole, which he had, as only child.&nbsp; He told
his aunt of the provision for her (Madame Babette&rsquo;s) life, which
he would make on the day when he married Mam&rsquo;selle Cannes.&nbsp;
And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;Babette saw that in his eye and look which
made her more and more reluctant to confide in him.&nbsp; By-and-by
he tried threats.&nbsp; She should leave the conci&egrave;rgerie, and
find employment where she liked.&nbsp; Still silence.&nbsp; Then he
grew angry, and swore that he would inform against her at the bureau
of the Directory, for harbouring an aristocrat; an aristocrat he knew
Mademoiselle was, whatever her real name might be.&nbsp; His aunt should
have a domiciliary visit, and see how she liked that.&nbsp; The officers
of the Government were the people for finding out secrets.&nbsp; In
vain she reminded him that, by so doing, he would expose to imminent
danger the lady whom he had professed to love.&nbsp; He told her, with
a sullen relapse into silence after his vehement outpouring of passion,
never to trouble herself about that.&nbsp; At last he wearied out the
old woman, and, frightened alike of herself and of him, she told him
all,&mdash;that Mam&rsquo;selle Cannes was Mademoiselle Virginie de
Cr&eacute;quy, daughter of the Count of that name.&nbsp; Who was the
Count?&nbsp; Younger brother of the Marquis.&nbsp; Where was the Marquis?&nbsp;
Dead long ago, leaving a widow and child.&nbsp; A son? (eagerly).&nbsp;
Yes, a son.&nbsp; Where was he?&nbsp; Parbleu! how should she know?&mdash;for
her courage returned a little as the talk went away from the only person
of the De Cr&eacute;quy family that she cared about.&nbsp; But, by dint
of some small glasses out of a bottle of Antoine Meyer&rsquo;s, she
told him more about the De Cr&eacute;quys than she liked afterwards
to remember.&nbsp; For the exhilaration of the brandy lasted but a very
short time, and she came home, as I have said, depressed, with a presentiment
of coming evil.&nbsp; She would not answer Pierre, but cuffed him about
in a manner to which the spoilt boy was quite unaccustomed.&nbsp; His
cousin&rsquo;s short, angry words, and sudden withdrawal of confidence,&mdash;his
mother&rsquo;s unwonted crossness and fault-finding, all made Virginie&rsquo;s
kind, gentle treatment, more than ever charming to the lad.&nbsp; He
half resolved to tell her how he had been acting as a spy upon her actions,
and at whose desire he had done it.&nbsp; But he was afraid of Morin,
and of the vengeance which he was sure would fall upon him for any breach
of confidence.&nbsp; Towards half-past eight that evening&mdash;Pierre,
watching, saw Virginie arrange several little things&mdash;she was in
the inner room, but he sat where he could see her through the glazed
partition.&nbsp; His mother sat&mdash;apparently sleeping&mdash;in the
great easy-chair; Virginie moved about softly, for fear of disturbing
her.&nbsp; She made up one or two little parcels of the few things she
could call her own: one packet she concealed about herself&mdash;the
others she directed, and left on the shelf.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is going,&rsquo;
thought Pierre, and (as he said in giving me the account) his heart
gave a spring, to think that he should never see her again.&nbsp; If
either his mother or his cousin had been more kind to him, he might
have endeavoured to intercept her; but as it was, he held his breath,
and when she came out he pretended to read, scarcely knowing whether
he wished her to succeed in the purpose which he was almost sure she
entertained, or not.&nbsp; She stopped by him, and passed her hand over
his hair.&nbsp; He told me that his eyes filled with tears at this caress.&nbsp;
Then she stood for a moment looking at the sleeping Madame Babette,
and stooped down and softly kissed her on the forehead.&nbsp; Pierre
dreaded lest his mother should awake (for by this time the wayward,
vacillating boy must have been quite on Virginie&rsquo;s side), but
the brandy she had drunk made her slumber heavily.&nbsp; Virginie went.&nbsp;
Pierre&rsquo;s heart beat fast.&nbsp; He was sure his cousin would try
to intercept her; but how, he could not imagine.&nbsp; He longed to
run out and see the catastrophe,&mdash;but he had let the moment slip;
he was also afraid of reawakening his mother to her unusual state of
anger and violence.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre went on pretending to read, but in reality listening
with acute tension of ear to every little sound.&nbsp; His perceptions
became so sensitive in this respect that he was incapable of measuring
time, every moment had seemed so full of noises, from the beating of
his heart up to the roll of the heavy carts in the distance.&nbsp; He
wondered whether Virginie would have reached the place of rendezvous,
and yet he was unable to compute the passage of minutes.&nbsp; His mother
slept soundly: that was well.&nbsp; By this time Virginie must have
met the &lsquo;faithful cousin:&rsquo; if, indeed, Morin had not made
his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, he felt as if he could no longer sit still, awaiting
the issue, but must run out and see what course events had taken.&nbsp;
In vain his mother, half-rousing herself, called after him to ask whither
he was going: he was already out of hearing before she had ended her
sentence, and he ran on until, stopped by the sight of Mademoiselle
Cannes walking along at so swift a pace that it was almost a run; while
at her side, resolutely keeping by her, Morin was striding abreast.&nbsp;
Pierre had just turned the corner of the street, when he came upon them.&nbsp;
Virginie would have passed him without recognizing him, she was in such
passionate agitation, but for Morin&rsquo;s gesture, by which he would
fain have kept Pierre from interrupting them.&nbsp; Then, when Virginie
saw the lad, she caught at his arm, and thanked God, as if in that boy
of twelve or fourteen she held a protector.&nbsp; Pierre felt her tremble
from head to foot, and was afraid lest she would fall, there where she
stood, in the hard rough street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Begone, Pierre!&rsquo; said Morin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; replied Pierre, who indeed was held
firmly by Virginie.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides, I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who has been frightening mademoiselle in this way?&rsquo; asked
he, very much inclined to brave his cousin at all hazards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle is not accustomed to walk in the streets
alone,&rsquo; said Morin, sulkily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She came upon a crowd
attracted by the arrest of an aristocrat, and their cries alarmed her.&nbsp;
I offered to take charge of her home.&nbsp; Mademoiselle should not
walk in these streets alone.&nbsp; We are not like the cold-blooded
people of the Faubourg Saint Germain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virginie did not speak.&nbsp; Pierre doubted if she heard
a word of what they were saying.&nbsp; She leant upon him more and more
heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will mademoiselle condescend to take my arm?&rsquo;
said Morin, with sulky, and yet humble, uncouthness.&nbsp; I dare say
he would have given worlds if he might have had that little hand within
his arm; but, though she still kept silence, she shuddered up away from
him, as you shrink from touching a toad.&nbsp; He had said something
to her during that walk, you may be sure, which had made her loathe
him.&nbsp; He marked and understood the gesture.&nbsp; He held himself
aloof while Pierre gave her all the assistance he could in their slow
progress homewards.&nbsp; But Morin accompanied her all the same.&nbsp;
He had played too desperate a game to be baulked now.&nbsp; He had given
information against the ci-devant Marquis de Cr&eacute;quy, as a returned
emigr&eacute;, to be met with at such a time, in such a place.&nbsp;
Morin had hoped that all sign of the arrest would have been cleared
away before Virginie reached the spot&mdash;so swiftly were terrible
deeds done in those days.&nbsp; But Cl&eacute;ment defended himself
desperately: Virginie was punctual to a second; and, though the wounded
man was borne off to the Abbaye, amid a crowd of the unsympathising
jeerers who mingled with the armed officials of the Directory, Morin
feared lest Virginie had recognized him; and he would have preferred
that she should have thought that the &lsquo;faithful cousin&rsquo;
was faithless, than that she should have seen him in bloody danger on
her account.&nbsp; I suppose he fancied that, if Virginie never saw
or heard more of him, her imagination would not dwell on his simple
disappearance, as it would do if she knew what he was suffering for
her sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, Pierre saw that his cousin was deeply mortified
by the whole tenor of his behaviour during their walk home.&nbsp; When
they arrived at Madame Babette&rsquo;s, Virginie fell fainting on the
floor; her strength had but just sufficed for this exertion of reaching
the shelter of the house.&nbsp; Her first sign of restoring consciousness
consisted in avoidance of Morin.&nbsp; He had been most assiduous in
his efforts to bring her round; quite tender in his way, Pierre said;
and this marked, instinctive repugnance to him evidently gave him extreme
pain.&nbsp; I suppose Frenchmen are more demonstrative than we are;
for Pierre declared that he saw his cousin&rsquo;s eyes fill with tears,
as she shrank away from his touch, if he tried to arrange the shawl
they had laid under her head like a pillow, or as she shut her eyes
when he passed before her.&nbsp; Madame Babette was urgent with her
to go and lie down on the bed in the inner room; but it was some time
before she was strong enough to rise and do this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Madame Babette returned from arranging the girl comfortably,
the three relations sat down in silence; a silence which Pierre thought
would never be broken.&nbsp; He wanted his mother to ask his cousin
what had happened.&nbsp; But Madame Babette was afraid of her nephew,
and thought it more discreet to wait for such crumbs of intelligence
as he might think fit to throw to her.&nbsp; But, after she had twice
reported Virginie to be asleep, without a word being uttered in reply
to her whispers by either of her companions, Morin&rsquo;s powers of
self-containment gave way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is hard!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is hard?&rsquo; asked Madame Babette, after she
had paused for a time, to enable him to add to, or to finish, his sentence,
if he pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is hard for a man to love a woman as I do,&rsquo;
he went on&mdash;&lsquo;I did not seek to love her, it came upon me
before I was aware&mdash;before I had ever thought about it at all,
I loved her better than all the world beside.&nbsp; All my life, before
I knew her, seems a dull blank.&nbsp; I neither know nor care for what
I did before then.&nbsp; And now there are just two lives before me.&nbsp;
Either I have her, or I have not.&nbsp; That is all: but that is everything.&nbsp;
And what can I do to make her have me?&nbsp; Tell me, aunt,&rsquo; and
he caught at Madame Babette&rsquo;s arm, and gave it so sharp a shake,
that she half screamed out, Pierre said, and evidently grew alarmed
at her nephew&rsquo;s excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush, Victor!&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are
other women in the world, if this one will not have you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None other for me,&rsquo; he said, sinking back as
if hopeless.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am plain and coarse, not one of the scented
darlings of the aristocrats.&nbsp; Say that I am ugly, brutish; I did
not make myself so, any more than I made myself love her.&nbsp; It is
my fate.&nbsp; But am I to submit to the consequences of my fate without
a struggle?&nbsp; Not I.&nbsp; As strong as my love is, so strong is
my will.&nbsp; It can be no stronger,&rsquo; continued he, gloomily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Aunt Babette, you must help me&mdash;you must make her love me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He was so fierce here, that Pierre said he did not wonder that his mother
was frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I, Victor!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I make
her love you?&nbsp; How can I?&nbsp; Ask me to speak for you to Mademoiselle
Didot, or to Mademoiselle Cauchois even, or to such as they, and I&rsquo;ll
do it, and welcome.&nbsp; But to Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy, why
you don&rsquo;t know the difference!&nbsp; Those people&mdash;the old
nobility I mean&mdash;why they don&rsquo;t know a man from a dog, out
of their own rank!&nbsp; And no wonder, for the young gentlemen of quality
are treated differently to us from their very birth.&nbsp; If she had
you to-morrow, you would be miserable.&nbsp; Let me alone for knowing
the aristocracy.&nbsp; I have not been a conci&egrave;rge to a duke
and three counts for nothing.&nbsp; I tell you, all your ways are different
to her ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would change my &ldquo;ways,&rdquo; as you call them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be reasonable, Victor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I will not be reasonable, if by that you mean giving
her up.&nbsp; I tell you two lives are before me; one with her, one
without her.&nbsp; But the latter will be but a short career for both
of us.&nbsp; You said, aunt, that the talk went in the conci&egrave;rgerie
of her father&rsquo;s hotel, that she would have nothing to do with
this cousin whom I put out of the way to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So the servants said.&nbsp; How could I know?&nbsp;
All I know is, that he left off coming to our hotel, and that at one
time before then he had never been two days absent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So much the better for him.&nbsp; He suffers now for
having come between me and my object&mdash;in trying to snatch her away
out of my sight.&nbsp; Take you warning, Pierre!&nbsp; I did not like
your meddling to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he went off, leaving Madam
Babette rocking herself backwards and forwards, in all the depression
of spirits consequent upon the reaction after the brandy, and upon her
knowledge of her nephew&rsquo;s threatened purpose combined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In telling you most of this, I have simply repeated Pierre&rsquo;s
account, which I wrote down at the time.&nbsp; But here what he had
to say came to a sudden break; for, the next morning, when Madame Babette
rose, Virginie was missing, and it was some time before either she,
or Pierre, or Morin, could get the slightest clue to the missing girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I must take up the story as it was told to the Intendant
Fl&eacute;chier by the old gardener Jacques, with whom Cl&eacute;ment
had been lodging on his first arrival in Paris.&nbsp; The old man could
not, I dare say, remember half as much of what had happened as Pierre
did; the former had the dulled memory of age, while Pierre had evidently
thought over the whole series of events as a story&mdash;as a play,
if one may call it so&mdash;during the solitary hours in his after-life,
wherever they were passed, whether in lonely camp watches, or in the
foreign prison, where he had to drag out many years.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment
had, as I said, returned to the gardener&rsquo;s garret after he had
been dismissed from the H&ocirc;tel Duguesclin.&nbsp; There were several
reasons for his thus doubling back.&nbsp; One was, that he put nearly
the whole breadth of Paris between him and an enemy; though why Morin
was an enemy, and to what extent he carried his dislike or hatred, Cl&eacute;ment
could not tell, of course.&nbsp; The next reason for returning to Jacques
was, no doubt, the conviction that, in multiplying his residences, he
multiplied the chances against his being suspected and recognized.&nbsp;
And then, again, the old man was in his secret, and his ally, although
perhaps but a feeble kind of one.&nbsp; It was through Jacques that
the plan of communication, by means of a nosegay of pinks, had been
devised; and it was Jacques who procured him the last disguise that
Cl&eacute;ment was to use in Paris&mdash;as he hoped and trusted.&nbsp;
It was that of a respectable shopkeeper of no particular class; a dress
that would have seemed perfectly suitable to the young man who would
naturally have worn it; and yet, as Cl&eacute;ment put it on, and adjusted
it&mdash;giving it a sort of finish and elegance which I always noticed
about his appearance and which I believed was innate in the wearer&mdash;I
have no doubt it seemed like the usual apparel of a gentleman.&nbsp;
No coarseness of texture, nor clumsiness of cut could disguise the nobleman
of thirty descents, it appeared; for immediately on arriving at the
place of rendezvous, he was recognized by the men placed there on Morin&rsquo;s
information to seize him.&nbsp; Jacques, following at a little distance,
with a bundle under his arm containing articles of feminine disguise
for Virginie, saw four men attempt Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s arrest&mdash;saw
him, quick as lightning, draw a sword hitherto concealed in a clumsy
stick&mdash;saw his agile figure spring to his guard,&mdash;and saw
him defend himself with the rapidity and art of a man skilled in arms.&nbsp;
But what good did it do? as Jacques piteously used to ask, Monsieur
Fl&eacute;chier told me.&nbsp; A great blow from a heavy club on the
sword-arm of Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy laid it helpless and immovable
by his side.&nbsp; Jacques always thought that that blow came from one
of the spectators, who by this time had collected round the scene of
the affray.&nbsp; The next instant, his master&mdash;his little marquis&mdash;was
down among the feet of the crowd, and though he was up again before
he had received much damage&mdash;so active and light was my poor Cl&eacute;ment&mdash;it
was not before the old gardener had hobbled forwards, and, with many
an old-fashioned oath and curse, proclaimed himself a partisan of the
losing side&mdash;a follower of a ci-devant aristocrat.&nbsp; It was
quite enough.&nbsp; He received one or two good blows, which were, in
fact, aimed at his master; and then, almost before he was aware, he
found his arms pinioned behind him with a woman&rsquo;s garter, which
one of the viragos in the crowd had made no scruple of pulling off in
public, as soon as she heard for what purpose it was wanted.&nbsp; Poor
Jacques was stunned and unhappy,&mdash;his master was out of sight,
on before; and the old gardener scarce knew whither they were taking
him.&nbsp; His head ached from the blows which had fallen upon it; it
was growing dark&mdash;June day though it was,&mdash;and when first
he seems to have become exactly aware of what had happened to him, it
was when he was turned into one of the larger rooms of the Abbaye, in
which all were put who had no other allotted place wherein to sleep.&nbsp;
One or two iron lamps hung from the ceiling by chains, giving a dim
light for a little circle.&nbsp; Jacques stumbled forwards over a sleeping
body lying on the ground.&nbsp; The sleeper wakened up enough to complain;
and the apology of the old man in reply caught the ear of his master,
who, until this time, could hardly have been aware of the straits and
difficulties of his faithful Jacques.&nbsp; And there they sat,&mdash;against
a pillar, the live-long night, holding one another&rsquo;s hands, and
each restraining expressions of pain, for fear of adding to the other&rsquo;s
distress.&nbsp; That night made them intimate friends, in spite of the
difference of age and rank.&nbsp; The disappointed hopes, the acute
suffering of the present, the apprehensions of the future, made them
seek solace in talking of the past.&nbsp; Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy
and the gardener found themselves disputing with interest in which chimney
of the stack the starling used to build,&mdash;the starling whose nest
Cl&eacute;ment sent to Urian, you remember, and discussing the merits
of different espalier-pears which grew, and may grow still, in the old
garden of the H&ocirc;tel de Cr&eacute;quy.&nbsp; Towards morning both
fell asleep.&nbsp; The old man wakened first.&nbsp; His frame was deadened
to suffering, I suppose, for he felt relieved of his pain; but Cl&eacute;ment
moaned and cried in feverish slumber.&nbsp; His broken arm was beginning
to inflame his blood.&nbsp; He was, besides, much injured by some kicks
from the crowd as he fell.&nbsp; As the old man looked sadly on the
white, baked lips, and the flushed cheeks, contorted with suffering
even in his sleep, Cl&eacute;ment gave a sharp cry which disturbed his
miserable neighbours, all slumbering around in uneasy attitudes.&nbsp;
They bade him with curses be silent; and then turning round, tried again
to forget their own misery in sleep.&nbsp; For you see, the bloodthirsty
canaille had not been sated with guillotining and hanging all the nobility
they could find, but were now informing, right and left, even against
each other; and when Cl&eacute;ment and Jacques were in the prison,
there were few of gentle blood in the place, and fewer still of gentle
manners.&nbsp; At the sound of the angry words and threats, Jacques
thought it best to awaken his master from his feverish uncomfortable
sleep, lest he should provoke more enmity; and, tenderly lifting him
up, he tried to adjust his own body, so that it should serve as a rest
and a pillow for the younger man.&nbsp; The motion aroused Cl&eacute;ment,
and he began to talk in a strange, feverish way, of Virginie, too,&mdash;whose
name he would not have breathed in such a place had he been quite himself.&nbsp;
But Jacques had as much delicacy of feeling as any lady in the land,
although, mind you, he knew neither how to read nor write,&mdash;and
bent his head low down, so that his master might tell him in a whisper
what messages he was to take to Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy, in case&mdash;Poor
Cl&eacute;ment, he knew it must come to that!&nbsp; No escape for him
now, in Norman disguise or otherwise!&nbsp; Either by gathering fever
or guillotine, death was sure of his prey.&nbsp; Well! when that happened,
Jacques was to go and find Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy, and tell her
that her cousin loved her at the last as he had loved her at the first;
but that she should never have heard another word of his attachment
from his living lips; that he knew he was not good enough for her, his
queen; and that no thought of earning her love by his devotion had prompted
his return to France, only that, if possible, he might have the great
privilege of serving her whom he loved.&nbsp; And then he went off into
rambling talk about petit-ma&icirc;tres, and such kind of expressions,
said Jacques to Fl&eacute;chier, the intendant, little knowing what
a clue that one word gave to much of the poor lad&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer morning came slowly on in that dark prison, and
when Jacques could look round&mdash;his master was now sleeping on his
shoulder, still the uneasy, starting sleep of fever&mdash;he saw that
there were many women among the prisoners.&nbsp; (I have heard some
of those who have escaped from the prisons say, that the look of despair
and agony that came into the faces of the prisoners on first wakening,
as the sense of their situation grew upon them, was what lasted the
longest in the memory of the survivors.&nbsp; This look, they said,
passed away from the women&rsquo;s faces sooner than it did from those
of the men.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Jacques kept falling asleep, and plucking himself
up again for fear lest, if he did not attend to his master, some harm
might come to the swollen, helpless arm.&nbsp; Yet his weariness grew
upon him in spite of all his efforts, and at last he felt as if he must
give way to the irresistible desire, if only for five minutes.&nbsp;
But just then there was a bustle at the door.&nbsp; Jacques opened his
eyes wide to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The gaoler is early with breakfast,&rsquo; said some
one, lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is the darkness of this accursed place that makes
us think it early,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time a parley was going on at the door.&nbsp; Some
one came in; not the gaoler&mdash;a woman.&nbsp; The door was shut to
and locked behind her.&nbsp; She only advanced a step or two, for it
was too sudden a change, out of the light into that dark shadow, for
any one to see clearly for the first few minutes.&nbsp; Jacques had
his eyes fairly open now, and was wide awake.&nbsp; It was Mademoiselle
de Cr&eacute;quy, looking bright, clear, and resolute.&nbsp; The faithful
heart of the old man read that look like an open page.&nbsp; Her cousin
should not die there on her behalf, without at least the comfort of
her sweet presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here he is,&rsquo; he whispered as her gown would have
touched him in passing, without her perceiving him, in the heavy obscurity
of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The good God bless you, my friend!&rsquo; she murmured,
as she saw the attitude of the old man, propped against a pillar, and
holding Cl&eacute;ment in his arms, as if the young man had been a helpless
baby, while one of the poor gardener&rsquo;s hands supported the broken
limb in the easiest position.&nbsp; Virginie sat down by the old man,
and held out her arms.&nbsp; Softly she moved Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s
head to her own shoulder; softly she transferred the task of holding
the arm to herself.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment lay on the floor, but she supported
him, and Jacques was at liberty to arise and stretch and shake his stiff,
weary old body.&nbsp; He then sat down at a little distance, and watched
the pair until he fell asleep.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment had muttered &lsquo;Virginie,&rsquo;
as they half-roused him by their movements out of his stupor; but Jacques
thought he was only dreaming; nor did he seem fully awake when once
his eyes opened, and he looked full at Virginie&rsquo;s face bending
over him, and growing crimson under his gaze, though she never stirred,
for fear of hurting him if she moved.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment looked in
silence, until his heavy eyelids came slowly down, and he fell into
his oppressive slumber again.&nbsp; Either he did not recognize her,
or she came in too completely as a part of his sleeping visions for
him to be disturbed by her appearance there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jacques awoke it was full daylight&mdash;at least as
full as it would ever be in that place.&nbsp; His breakfast&mdash;the
gaol-allowance of bread and vin ordinaire&mdash;was by his side.&nbsp;
He must have slept soundly.&nbsp; He looked for his master.&nbsp; He
and Virginie had recognized each other now,&mdash;hearts, as well as
appearance.&nbsp; They were smiling into each other&rsquo;s faces, as
if that dull, vaulted room in the grim Abbaye were the sunny gardens
of Versailles, with music and festivity all abroad.&nbsp; Apparently
they had much to say to each other; for whispered questions and answers
never ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virginie had made a sling for the poor broken arm; nay, she
had obtained two splinters of wood in some way, and one of their fellow-prisoners&mdash;having,
it appeared, some knowledge of surgery&mdash;had set it.&nbsp; Jacques
felt more desponding by far than they did, for he was suffering from
the night he had passed, which told upon his aged frame; while they
must have heard some good news, as it seemed to him, so bright and happy
did they look.&nbsp; Yet Cl&eacute;ment was still in bodily pain and
suffering, and Virginie, by her own act and deed, was a prisoner in
that dreadful Abbaye, whence the only issue was the guillotine.&nbsp;
But they were together: they loved: they understood each other at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Virginie saw that Jacques was awake, and languidly munching
his breakfast, she rose from the wooden stool on which she was sitting,
and went to him, holding out both hands, and refusing to allow him to
rise, while she thanked him with pretty eagerness for all his kindness
to Monsieur.&nbsp; Monsieur himself came towards him, following Virginie,
but with tottering steps, as if his head was weak and dizzy, to thank
the poor old man, who now on his feet, stood between them, ready to
cry while they gave him credit for faithful actions which he felt to
have been almost involuntary on his part,&mdash;for loyalty was like
an instinct in the good old days, before your educational cant had come
up.&nbsp; And so two days went on.&nbsp; The only event was the morning
call for the victims, a certain number of whom were summoned to trial
every day.&nbsp; And to be tried was to be condemned.&nbsp; Every one
of the prisoners became grave, as the hour for their summons approached.&nbsp;
Most of the victims went to their doom with uncomplaining resignation,
and for a while after their departure there was comparative silence
in the prison.&nbsp; But, by-and-by&mdash;so said Jacques&mdash;the
conversation or amusements began again.&nbsp; Human nature cannot stand
the perpetual pressure of such keen anxiety, without an effort to relieve
itself by thinking of something else.&nbsp; Jacques said that Monsieur
and Mademoiselle were for ever talking together of the past days,&mdash;it
was &lsquo;Do you remember this?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Do you remember that?&rsquo;
perpetually.&nbsp; He sometimes thought they forgot where they were,
and what was before them.&nbsp; But Jacques did not, and every day he
trembled more and more as the list was called over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third morning of their incarceration, the gaoler brought
in a man whom Jacques did not recognize, and therefore did not at once
observe; for he was waiting, as in duty bound, upon his master and his
sweet young lady (as he always called her in repeating the story).&nbsp;
He thought that the new introduction was some friend of the gaoler,
as the two seemed well acquainted, and the latter stayed a few minutes
talking with his visitor before leaving him in prison.&nbsp; So Jacques
was surprised when, after a short time had elapsed, he looked round,
and saw the fierce stare with which the stranger was regarding Monsieur
and Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy, as the pair sat at breakfast,&mdash;the
said breakfast being laid as well as Jacques knew how, on a bench fastened
into the prison wall,&mdash;Virginie sitting on her low stool, and Cl&eacute;ment
half lying on the ground by her side, and submitting gladly to be fed
by her pretty white fingers; for it was one of her fancies, Jacques
said, to do all she could for him, in consideration of his broken arm.&nbsp;
And, indeed, Cl&eacute;ment was wasting away daily; for he had received
other injuries, internal and more serious than that to his arm, during
the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e which had ended in his capture.&nbsp; The stranger
made Jacques conscious of his presence by a sigh, which was almost a
groan.&nbsp; All three prisoners looked round at the sound.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s
face expressed little but scornful indifference; but Virginie&rsquo;s
face froze into stony hate.&nbsp; Jacques said he never saw such a look,
and hoped that he never should again.&nbsp; Yet after that first revelation
of feeling, her look was steady and fixed in another direction to that
in which the stranger stood,&mdash;still motionless&mdash;still watching.&nbsp;
He came a step nearer at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; Not the quivering
of an eyelash showed that she heard him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mademoiselle!&rsquo;
he said again, with an intensity of beseeching that made Jacques&mdash;not
knowing who he was&mdash;almost pity him, when he saw his young lady&rsquo;s
obdurate face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was perfect silence for a space of time which Jacques
could not measure.&nbsp; Then again the voice, hesitatingly, saying,
&lsquo;Monsieur!&rsquo;&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment could not hold the same
icy countenance as Virginie; he turned his head with an impatient gesture
of disgust; but even that emboldened the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur, do ask mademoiselle to listen to me,&mdash;just
two words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy only listens to whom
she chooses.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very haughtily my Cl&eacute;ment would say
that, I am sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, mademoiselle,&rsquo;&mdash;lowering his voice,
and coming a step or two nearer.&nbsp; Virginie must have felt his approach,
though she did not see it; for she drew herself a little on one side,
so as to put as much space as possible between him and her.&mdash;&lsquo;Mademoiselle,
it is not too late.&nbsp; I can save you: but to-morrow your name is
down on the list.&nbsp; I can save you, if you will listen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still no word or sign.&nbsp; Jacques did not understand the
affair.&nbsp; Why was she so obdurate to one who might be ready to include
Cl&eacute;ment in the proposal, as far as Jacques knew?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man withdrew a little, but did not offer to leave the
prison.&nbsp; He never took his eyes off Virginie; he seemed to be suffering
from some acute and terrible pain as he watched her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques cleared away the breakfast-things as well as he could.&nbsp;
Purposely, as I suspect, he passed near the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hist!&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are
Jacques, the gardener, arrested for assisting an aristocrat.&nbsp; I
know the gaoler.&nbsp; You shall escape, if you will.&nbsp; Only take
this message from me to mademoiselle.&nbsp; You heard.&nbsp; She will
not listen to me: I did not want her to come here.&nbsp; I never knew
she was here, and she will die to-morrow.&nbsp; They will put her beautiful
round throat under the guillotine.&nbsp; Tell her, good old man, tell
her how sweet life is; and how I can save her; and how I will not ask
for more than just to see her from time to time.&nbsp; She is so young;
and death is annihilation, you know.&nbsp; Why does she hate me so?&nbsp;
I want to save her; I have done her no harm.&nbsp; Good old man, tell
her how terrible death is; and that she will die to-morrow, unless she
listens to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques saw no harm in repeating this message.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment
listened in silence, watching Virginie with an air of infinite tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you not try him, my cherished one?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Towards you he may mean well&rsquo; (which makes me think that
Virginie had never repeated to Cl&eacute;ment the conversation which
she had overheard that last night at Madame Babette&rsquo;s); &lsquo;you
would be in no worse a situation than you were before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No worse, Cl&eacute;ment! and I should have known what
you were, and have lost you.&nbsp; My Cl&eacute;ment!&rsquo; said she,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ask him,&rsquo; said she, turning to Jacques, suddenly,
&lsquo;if he can save Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy as well,&mdash;if he
can?&mdash;O Cl&eacute;ment, we might escape to England; we are but
young.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she hid her face on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques returned to the stranger, and asked him Virginie&rsquo;s
question.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed on the cousins; he was very pale,
and the twitchings or contortions, which must have been involuntary
whenever he was agitated, convulsed his whole body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a long pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will save mademoiselle
and monsieur, if she will go straight from prison to the mairie, and
be my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your wife!&rsquo; Jacques could not help exclaiming,
&lsquo;That she will never be&mdash;never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ask her!&rsquo; said Morin, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But almost before Jacques thought he could have fairly uttered
the words, Cl&eacute;ment caught their meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Begone!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;not one word more.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Virginie touched the old man as he was moving away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
him he does not know how he makes me welcome death.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
smiling, as if triumphant, she turned again to Cl&eacute;ment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger did not speak as Jacques gave him the meaning,
not the words, of their replies.&nbsp; He was going away, but stopped.&nbsp;
A minute or two afterwards, he beckoned to Jacques.&nbsp; The old gardener
seems to have thought it undesirable to throw away even the chance of
assistance from such a man as this, for he went forward to speak to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen!&nbsp; I have influence with the gaoler.&nbsp;
He shall let thee pass out with the victims to-morrow.&nbsp; No one
will notice it, or miss thee&mdash;.&nbsp; They will be led to trial,&mdash;even
at the last moment, I will save her, if she sends me word she relents.&nbsp;
Speak to her, as the time draws on.&nbsp; Life is very sweet,&mdash;tell
her how sweet.&nbsp; Speak to him; he will do more with her than thou
canst.&nbsp; Let him urge her to live.&nbsp; Even at the last, I will
be at the Palais de Justice,&mdash;at the Gr&egrave;ve.&nbsp; I have
followers,&mdash;I have interest.&nbsp; Come among the crowd that follow
the victims,&mdash;I shall see thee.&nbsp; It will be no worse for him,
if she escapes&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Save my master, and I will do all,&rsquo; said Jacques.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only on my one condition,&rsquo; said Morin, doggedly;
and Jacques was hopeless of that condition ever being fulfilled.&nbsp;
But he did not see why his own life might not be saved.&nbsp; By remaining
in prison until the next day, he should have rendered every service
in his power to his master and the young lady.&nbsp; He, poor fellow,
shrank from death; and he agreed with Morin to escape, if he could,
by the means Morin had suggested, and to bring him word if Mademoiselle
de Cr&eacute;quy relented.&nbsp; (Jacques had no expectation that she
would; but I fancy he did not think it necessary to tell Morin of this
conviction of his.)&nbsp; This bargaining with so base a man for so
slight a thing as life, was the only flaw that I heard of in the old
gardener&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; Of course, the mere reopening of the
subject was enough to stir Virginie to displeasure.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment
urged her, it is true; but the light he had gained upon Morin&rsquo;s
motions, made him rather try to set the case before her in as fair a
manner as possible than use any persuasive arguments.&nbsp; And, even
as it was, what he said on the subject made Virginie shed tears&mdash;the
first that had fallen from her since she entered the prison.&nbsp; So,
they were summoned and went together, at the fatal call of the muster-roll
of victims the next morning.&nbsp; He, feeble from his wounds and his
injured health; she, calm and serene, only petitioning to be allowed
to walk next to him, in order that she might hold him up when he turned
faint and giddy from his extreme suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together they stood at the bar; together they were condemned.&nbsp;
As the words of judgment were pronounced, Virginie tuned to Cl&eacute;ment,
and embraced him with passionate fondness.&nbsp; Then, making him lean
on her, they marched out towards the Place de la Gr&egrave;ve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques was free now.&nbsp; He had told Morin how fruitless
his efforts at persuasion had been; and scarcely caring to note the
effect of his information upon the man, he had devoted himself to watching
Monsieur and Mademoiselle de Cr&eacute;quy.&nbsp; And now he followed
them to the Place de la Gr&egrave;ve.&nbsp; He saw them mount the platform;
saw them kneel down together till plucked up by the impatient officials;
could see that she was urging some request to the executioner; the end
of which seemed to be, that Cl&eacute;ment advanced first to the guillotine,
was executed (and just at this moment there was a stir among the crowd,
as of a man pressing forward towards the scaffold).&nbsp; Then she,
standing with her face to the guillotine, slowly made the sign of the
cross, and knelt down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques covered his eyes, blinded with tears.&nbsp; The report
of a pistol made him look up.&nbsp; She was gone&mdash;another victim
in her place&mdash;and where there had been a little stir in the crowd
not five minutes before, some men were carrying off a dead body.&nbsp;
A man had shot himself, they said.&nbsp; Pierre told me who that man
was.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>After a pause, I ventured to ask what became of Madame de Cr&eacute;quy,
Cl&eacute;ment&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never made any inquiry about him,&rdquo; said my lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She must have known that he was dead; though how, we never could
tell.&nbsp; Medlicott remembered afterwards that it was about, if not
on&mdash;Medlicott to this day declares that it was on the very Monday,
June the nineteenth, when her son was executed, that Madame de Cr&eacute;quy
left off her rouge and took to her bed, as one bereaved and hopeless.&nbsp;
It certainly was about that time; and Medlicott&mdash;who was deeply
impressed by that dream of Madame de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s (the relation
of which I told you had had such an effect on my lord), in which she
had seen the figure of Virginie&mdash;as the only light object amid
much surrounding darkness as of night, smiling and beckoning Cl&eacute;ment
on&mdash;on&mdash;till at length the bright phantom stopped, motionless,
and Madame de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s eyes began to penetrate the murky
darkness, and to see closing around her the gloomy dripping walls which
she had once seen and never forgotten&mdash;the walls of the vault of
the chapel of the De Cr&eacute;quys in Saint Germain l&rsquo;Auxerrois;
and there the two last of the Cr&eacute;quys laid them down among their
forefathers, and Madame de Cr&eacute;quy had wakened to the sound of
the great door, which led to the open air, being locked upon her&mdash;I
say Medlicott, who was predisposed by this dream to look out for the
supernatural, always declared that Madame de Cr&eacute;quy was made
conscious in some mysterious way, of her son&rsquo;s death, on the very
day and hour when it occurred, and that after that she had no more anxiety,
but was only conscious of a kind of stupefying despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of her, my lady?&rdquo; I again asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could become of her?&rdquo; replied Lady Ludlow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She never could be induced to rise again, though she lived more
than a year after her son&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp; She kept her bed;
her room darkened, her face turned towards the wall, whenever any one
besides Medlicott was in the room.&nbsp; She hardly ever spoke, and
would have died of starvation but for Medlicott&rsquo;s tender care,
in putting a morsel to her lips every now and then, feeding her, in
fact, just as an old bird feeds her young ones.&nbsp; In the height
of summer my lord and I left London.&nbsp; We would fain have taken
her with us into Scotland, but the doctor (we had the old doctor from
Leicester Square) forbade her removal; and this time he gave such good
reasons against it that I acquiesced.&nbsp; Medlicott and a maid were
left with her.&nbsp; Every care was taken of her.&nbsp; She survived
till our return.&nbsp; Indeed, I thought she was in much the same state
as I had left her in, when I came back to London.&nbsp; But Medlicott
spoke of her as much weaker; and one morning on awakening, they told
me she was dead.&nbsp; I sent for Medlicott, who was in sad distress,
she had become so fond of her charge.&nbsp; She said that, about two
o&rsquo;clock, she had been awakened by unusual restlessness on Madame
de Cr&eacute;quy&rsquo;s part; that she had gone to her bedside, and
found the poor lady feebly but perpetually moving her wasted arm up
and down&mdash;and saying to herself in a wailing voice: &lsquo;I did
not bless him when he left me&mdash;I did not bless him when he left
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Medlicott gave her a spoonful or two of jelly, and
sat by her, stroking her hand, and soothing her till she seemed to fall
asleep.&nbsp; But in the morning she was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sad story, your ladyship,&rdquo; said I, after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it is.&nbsp; People seldom arrive at my age without having
watched the beginning, middle, and end of many lives and many fortunes.&nbsp;
We do not talk about them, perhaps; for they are often so sacred to
us, from having touched into the very quick of our own hearts, as it
were, or into those of others who are dead and gone, and veiled over
from human sight, that we cannot tell the tale as if it was a mere story.&nbsp;
But young people should remember that we have had this solemn experience
of life, on which to base our opinions and form our judgments, so that
they are not mere untried theories.&nbsp; I am not alluding to Mr. Horner
just now, for he is nearly as old as I am&mdash;within ten years, I
dare say&mdash;but I am thinking of Mr. Gray, with his endless plans
for some new thing&mdash;schools, education, Sabbaths, and what not.&nbsp;
Now he has not seen what all this leads to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity he has not heard your ladyship tell the story
of poor Monsieur de Cr&eacute;quy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all a pity, my dear.&nbsp; A young man like him, who,
both by position and age, must have had his experience confined to a
very narrow circle, ought not to set up his opinion against mine; he
ought not to require reasons from me, nor to need such explanation of
my arguments (if I condescend to argue), as going into relation of the
circumstances on which my arguments are based in my own mind, would
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my lady, it might convince him,&rdquo; I said, with perhaps
injudicious perseverance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should he be convinced?&rdquo; she asked, with gentle
inquiry in her tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has only to acquiesce.&nbsp; Though
he is appointed by Mr. Croxton, I am the lady of the manor, as he must
know.&nbsp; But it is with Mr. Horner that I must have to do about this
unfortunate lad Gregson.&nbsp; I am afraid there will be no method of
making him forget his unlucky knowledge.&nbsp; His poor brains will
be intoxicated with the sense of his powers, without any counterbalancing
principles to guide him.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; I am quite afraid
it will end in his being hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Horner came to apologize and explain.&nbsp; He was
evidently&mdash;as I could tell from his voice, as he spoke to my lady
in the next room&mdash;extremely annoyed at her ladyship&rsquo;s discovery
of the education he had been giving to this boy.&nbsp; My lady spoke
with great authority, and with reasonable grounds of complaint.&nbsp;
Mr. Horner was well acquainted with her thoughts on the subject, and
had acted in defiance of her wishes.&nbsp; He acknowledged as much,
and should on no account have done it, in any other instance, without
her leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I could never have granted you,&rdquo; said my lady.</p>
<p>But this boy had extraordinary capabilities; would, in fact, have
taught himself much that was bad, if he had not been rescued, and another
direction given to his powers.&nbsp; And in all Mr. Horner had done,
he had had her ladyship&rsquo;s service in view.&nbsp; The business
was getting almost beyond his power, so many letters and so much account-keeping
was required by the complicated state in which things were.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow felt what was coming&mdash;a reference to the mortgage
for the benefit of my lord&rsquo;s Scottish estates, which, she was
perfectly aware, Mr. Horner considered as having been a most unwise
proceeding&mdash;and she hastened to observe&mdash;&ldquo;All this may
be very true, Mr. Horner, and I am sure I should be the last person
to wish you to overwork or distress yourself; but of that we will talk
another time.&nbsp; What I am now anxious to remedy is, if possible,
the state of this poor little Gregson&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Would not
hard work in the fields be a wholesome and excellent way of enabling
him to forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in hopes, my lady, that you would have permitted me
to bring him up to act as a kind of clerk,&rdquo; said Mr. Horner, jerking
out his project abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; asked my lady, in infinite surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of&mdash;of assistant, in the way of copying letters
and doing up accounts.&nbsp; He is already an excellent penman and very
quick at figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Horner,&rdquo; said my lady, with dignity, &ldquo;the
son of a poacher and vagabond ought never to have been able to copy
letters relating to the Hanbury estates; and, at any rate, he shall
not.&nbsp; I wonder how it is that, knowing the use he has made of his
power of reading a letter, you should venture to propose such an employment
for him as would require his being in your confidence, and you the trusted
agent of this family.&nbsp; Why, every secret (and every ancient and
honourable family has its secrets, as you know, Mr. Horner) would be
learnt off by heart, and repeated to the first comer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have hoped to have trained him, my lady, to understand
the rules of discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trained!&nbsp; Train a barn-door fowl to be a pheasant, Mr.
Horner!&nbsp; That would be the easier task.&nbsp; But you did right
to speak of discretion rather than honour.&nbsp; Discretion looks to
the consequences of actions&mdash;honour looks to the action itself,
and is an instinct rather than a virtue.&nbsp; After all, it is possible
you might have trained him to be discreet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Horner was silent.&nbsp; My lady was softened by his not replying,
and began as she always did in such cases, to fear lest she had been
too harsh.&nbsp; I could tell that by her voice and by her next speech,
as well as if I had seen her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am sorry you are feeling the pressure of the affairs:
I am quite aware that I have entailed much additional trouble upon you
by some of my measures: I must try and provide you with some suitable
assistance.&nbsp; Copying letters and doing up accounts, I think you
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Horner had certainly had a distant idea of turning the little
boy, in process of time, into a clerk; but he had rather urged this
possibility of future usefulness beyond what he had at first intended,
in speaking of it to my lady as a palliation of his offence, and he
certainly was very much inclined to retract his statement that the letter-writing,
or any other business, had increased, or that he was in the slightest
want of help of any kind, when my lady after a pause of consideration,
suddenly said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it.&nbsp; Miss Galindo will, I am sure, be glad to
assist you.&nbsp; I will speak to her myself.&nbsp; The payment we should
make to a clerk would be of real service to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could hardly help echoing Mr. Horner&rsquo;s tone of surprise as
he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Galindo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, you must be told who Miss Galindo was; at least, told as much
as I know.&nbsp; Miss Galindo had lived in the village for many years,
keeping house on the smallest possible means, yet always managing to
maintain a servant.&nbsp; And this servant was invariably chosen because
she had some infirmity that made her undesirable to every one else.&nbsp;
I believe Miss Galindo had had lame and blind and hump-backed maids.&nbsp;
She had even at one time taken in a girl hopelessly gone in consumption,
because if not she would have had to go to the workhouse, and not have
had enough to eat.&nbsp; Of course the poor creature could not perform
a single duty usually required of a servant, and Miss Galindo herself
was both servant and nurse.</p>
<p>Her present maid was scarcely four feet high, and bore a terrible
character for ill-temper.&nbsp; Nobody but Miss Galindo would have kept
her; but, as it was, mistress and servant squabbled perpetually, and
were, at heart, the best of friends.&nbsp; For it was one of Miss Galindo&rsquo;s
peculiarities to do all manner of kind and self-denying actions, and
to say all manner of provoking things.&nbsp; Lame, blind, deformed,
and dwarf, all came in for scoldings without number: it was only the
consumptive girl that never had heard a sharp word.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think any of her servants liked her the worse for her peppery temper,
and passionate odd ways, for they knew her real and beautiful kindness
of heart: and, besides, she had so great a turn for humour that very
often her speeches amused as much or more than they irritated; and on
the other side, a piece of witty impudence from her servant would occasionally
tickle her so much and so suddenly, that she would burst out laughing
in the middle of her passion.</p>
<p>But the talk about Miss Galindo&rsquo;s choice and management of
her servants was confined to village gossip, and had never reached my
Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s ears, though doubtless Mr. Horner was well acquainted
with it.&nbsp; What my lady knew of her amounted to this.&nbsp; It was
the custom in those days for the wealthy ladies of the county to set
on foot a repository, as it was called, in the assize-town.&nbsp; The
ostensible manager of this repository was generally a decayed gentlewoman,
a clergyman&rsquo;s widow, or so forth.&nbsp; She was, however, controlled
by a committee of ladies; and paid by them in proportion to the amount
of goods she sold; and these goods were the small manufactures of ladies
of little or no fortune, whose names, if they chose it, were only signified
by initials.</p>
<p>Poor water-colour drawings, indigo and Indian ink; screens, ornamented
with moss and dried leaves; paintings on velvet, and such faintly ornamental
works were displayed on one side of the shop.&nbsp; It was always reckoned
a mark of characteristic gentility in the repository, to have only common
heavy-framed sash-windows, which admitted very little light, so I never
was quite certain of the merit of these Works of Art as they were entitled.&nbsp;
But, on the other side, where the Useful Work placard was put up, there
was a great variety of articles, of whose unusual excellence every one
might judge.&nbsp; Such fine sewing, and stitching, and button-holing!&nbsp;
Such bundles of soft delicate knitted stockings and socks; and, above
all, in Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s eyes, such hanks of the finest spun flaxen
thread!</p>
<p>And the most delicate dainty work of all was done by Miss Galindo,
as Lady Ludlow very well knew.&nbsp; Yet, for all their fine sewing,
it sometimes happened that Miss Galindo&rsquo;s patterns were of an
old-fashioned kind; and the dozen nightcaps, maybe, on the materials
for which she had expended bon&acirc;-fide money, and on the making-up,
no little time and eye-sight, would lie for months in a yellow neglected
heap; and at such times, it was said, Miss Galindo was more amusing
than usual, more full of dry drollery and humour; just as at the times
when an order came in to X. (the initial she had chosen) for a stock
of well-paying things, she sat and stormed at her servant as she stitched
away.&nbsp; She herself explained her practice in this way:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When everything goes wrong, one would give up breathing if
one could not lighten ones heart by a joke.&nbsp; But when I&rsquo;ve
to sit still from morning till night, I must have something to stir
my blood, or I should go off into an apoplexy; so I set to, and quarrel
with Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were Miss Galindo&rsquo;s means and manner of living in her
own house.&nbsp; Out of doors, and in the village, she was not popular,
although she would have been sorely missed had she left the place.&nbsp;
But she asked too many home questions (not to say impertinent) respecting
the domestic economies (for even the very poor liked to spend their
bit of money their own way), and would open cupboards to find out hidden
extravagances, and question closely respecting the weekly amount of
butter, till one day she met with what would have been a rebuff to any
other person, but which she rather enjoyed than otherwise.</p>
<p>She was going into a cottage, and in the doorway met the good woman
chasing out a duck, and apparently unconscious of her visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out, Miss Galindo!&rdquo; she cried, addressing the duck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get out!&nbsp; O, I ask your pardon,&rdquo; she continued, as
if seeing the lady for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
that weary duck will come in.&nbsp; Get out Miss Gal---&rdquo; (to the
duck).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you call it after me, do you?&rdquo; inquired her
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes, ma&rsquo;am; my master would have it so, for he said,
sure enough the unlucky bird was always poking herself where she was
not wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! very good!&nbsp; And so your master is a wit, is he?&nbsp;
Well! tell him to come up and speak to me to-night about my parlour
chimney, for there is no one like him for chimney doctoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the master went up, and was so won over by Miss Galindo&rsquo;s
merry ways, and sharp insight into the mysteries of his various kinds
of business (he was a mason, chimney-sweeper, and ratcatcher), that
he came home and abused his wife the next time she called the duck the
name by which he himself had christened her.</p>
<p>But odd as Miss Galindo was in general, she could be as well-bred
a lady as any one when she chose.&nbsp; And choose she always did when
my Lady Ludlow was by.&nbsp; Indeed, I don&rsquo;t know the man, woman,
or child, that did not instinctively turn out its best side to her ladyship.&nbsp;
So she had no notion of the qualities which, I am sure, made Mr. Horner
think that Miss Galindo would be most unmanageable as a clerk, and heartily
wish that the idea had never come into my lady&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; But
there it was; and he had annoyed her ladyship already more than he liked
to-day, so he could not directly contradict her, but only urge difficulties
which he hoped might prove insuperable.&nbsp; But every one of them
Lady Ludlow knocked down.&nbsp; Letters to copy?&nbsp; Doubtless.&nbsp;
Miss Galindo could come up to the Hall; she should have a room to herself;
she wrote a beautiful hand; and writing would save her eyesight.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Capability with regard to accounts?&rdquo;&nbsp; My lady would
answer for that too; and for more than Mr. Horner seemed to think it
necessary to inquire about.&nbsp; Miss Galindo was by birth and breeding
a lady of the strictest honour, and would, if possible, forget the substance
of any letters that passed through her hands; at any rate, no one would
ever hear of them again from her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remuneration?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Oh! as for that, Lady Ludlow would herself take care that it was managed
in the most delicate manner possible.&nbsp; She would send to invite
Miss Galindo to tea at the Hall that very afternoon, if Mr. Horner would
only give her ladyship the slightest idea of the average length of time
that my lady was to request Miss Galindo to sacrifice to her daily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Three hours!&nbsp; Very well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Horner looked
very grave as he passed the windows of the room where I lay.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think he liked the idea of Miss Galindo as a clerk.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s invitations were like royal commands.&nbsp; Indeed,
the village was too quiet to allow the inhabitants to have many evening
engagements of any kind.&nbsp; Now and then, Mr. and Mrs. Horner gave
a tea and supper to the principal tenants and their wives, to which
the clergyman was invited, and Miss Galindo, Mrs. Medlicott, and one
or two other spinsters and widows.&nbsp; The glory of the supper-table
on these occasions was invariably furnished by her ladyship: it was
a cold roasted peacock, with his tail stuck out as if in life.&nbsp;
Mrs. Medlicott would take up the whole morning arranging the feathers
in the proper semicircle, and was always pleased with the wonder and
admiration it excited.&nbsp; It was considered a due reward and fitting
compliment to her exertions that Mr. Horner always took her in to supper,
and placed her opposite to the magnificent dish, at which she sweetly
smiled all the time they were at table.&nbsp; But since Mrs. Horner
had had the paralytic stroke these parties had been given up; and Miss
Galindo wrote a note to Lady Ludlow in reply to her invitation, saying
that she was entirely disengaged, and would have great pleasure in doing
herself the honour of waiting upon her ladyship.</p>
<p>Whoever visited my lady took their meals with her, sitting on the
dais, in the presence of all my former companions.&nbsp; So I did not
see Miss Galindo until some time after tea; as the young gentlewomen
had had to bring her their sewing and spinning, to hear the remarks
of so competent a judge.&nbsp; At length her ladyship brought her visitor
into the room where I lay,&mdash;it was one of my bad days, I remember,&mdash;in
order to have her little bit of private conversation.&nbsp; Miss Galindo
was dressed in her best gown, I am sure, but I had never seen anything
like it except in a picture, it was so old-fashioned.&nbsp; She wore
a white muslin apron, delicately embroidered, and put on a little crookedly,
in order, as she told us, even Lady Ludlow, before the evening was over,
to conceal a spot whence the colour had been discharged by a lemon-stain.&nbsp;
This crookedness had an odd effect, especially when I saw that it was
intentional; indeed, she was so anxious about her apron&rsquo;s right
adjustment in the wrong place, that she told us straight out why she
wore it so, and asked her ladyship if the spot was properly hidden,
at the same time lifting up her apron and showing her how large it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my father was alive, I always took his right arm, so,
and used to remove any spotted or discoloured breadths to the left side,
if it was a walking-dress.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the convenience of a gentleman.&nbsp;
But widows and spinsters must do what they can.&nbsp; Ah, my dear (to
me)! when you are reckoning up the blessings in your lot,&mdash;though
you may think it a hard one in some respects,&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget
how little your stockings want darning, as you are obliged to lie down
so much!&nbsp; I would rather knit two pairs of stockings than darn
one, any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been doing any of your beautiful knitting lately?&rdquo;
asked my lady, who had now arranged Miss Galindo in the pleasantest
chair, and taken her own little wicker-work one, and, having her work
in her hands, was ready to try and open the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and alas! your ladyship.&nbsp; It is partly the hot weather&rsquo;s
fault, for people seem to forget that winter must come; and partly,
I suppose, that every one is stocked who has the money to pay four-and-sixpence
a pair for stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may I ask if you have any time in your active days at
liberty?&rdquo; said my lady, drawing a little nearer to her proposal,
which I fancy she found it a little awkward to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the village keeps me busy, your ladyship, when I have
neither knitting or sewing to do.&nbsp; You know I took X. for my letter
at the repository, because it stands for Xantippe, who was a great scold
in old times, as I have learnt.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know how the world would get on without scolding, your ladyship.&nbsp;
It would go to sleep, and the sun would stand still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could bear to scold, Miss Galindo,&rdquo;
said her ladyship, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! because your ladyship has people to do it for you.&nbsp;
Begging your pardon, my lady, it seems to me the generality of people
may be divided into saints, scolds, and sinners.&nbsp; Now, your ladyship
is a saint, because you have a sweet and holy nature, in the first place;
and have people to do your anger and vexation for you, in the second
place.&nbsp; And Jonathan Walker is a sinner, because he is sent to
prison.&nbsp; But here am I, half way, having but a poor kind of disposition
at best, and yet hating sin, and all that leads to it, such as wasting,
and extravagance, and gossiping,&mdash;and yet all this lies right under
my nose in the village, and I am not saint enough to be vexed at it;
and so I scold.&nbsp; And though I had rather be a saint, yet I think
I do good in my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you do, dear Miss Galindo,&rdquo; said Lady Ludlow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I am sorry to hear that there is so much that is bad going
on in the village,&mdash;very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, your ladyship! then I am sorry I brought it out.&nbsp;
It was only by way of saying, that when I have no particular work to
do at home, I take a turn abroad, and set my neighbours to rights, just
by way of steering clear of Satan.</p>
<blockquote><p>For Satan finds some mischief still<br />
For idle hands to do,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you know, my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no leading into the subject by delicate degrees, for Miss
Galindo was evidently so fond of talking, that, if asked a question,
she made her answer so long, that before she came to an end of it, she
had wandered far away from the original starting point.&nbsp; So Lady
Ludlow plunged at once into what she had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Galindo, I have a great favour to ask of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady, I wish I could tell you what a pleasure it is to
hear you say so,&rdquo; replied Miss Galindo, almost with tears in her
eyes; so glad were we all to do anything for her ladyship, which could
be called a free service and not merely a duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this.&nbsp; Mr. Horner tells me that the business-letters,
relating to the estate, are multiplying so much that he finds it impossible
to copy them all himself, and I therefore require the services of some
confidential and discreet person to copy these letters, and occasionally
to go through certain accounts.&nbsp; Now, there is a very pleasant
little sitting-room very near to Mr. Horner&rsquo;s office (you know
Mr. Horner&rsquo;s office&mdash;on the other side of the stone hall?),
and if I could prevail upon you to come here to breakfast and afterwards
sit there for three hours every morning, Mr. Horner should bring or
send you the papers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow stopped.&nbsp; Miss Galindo&rsquo;s countenance had fallen.&nbsp;
There was some great obstacle in her mind to her wish for obliging Lady
Ludlow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would Sally do?&rdquo; she asked at length.&nbsp; Lady
Ludlow had not a notion who Sally was.&nbsp; Nor if she had had a notion,
would she have had a conception of the perplexities that poured into
Miss Galindo&rsquo;s mind, at the idea of leaving her rough forgetful
dwarf without the perpetual monitorship of her mistress.&nbsp; Lady
Ludlow, accustomed to a household where everything went on noiselessly,
perfectly, and by clock-work, conducted by a number of highly-paid,
well-chosen, and accomplished servants, had not a conception of the
nature of the rough material from which her servants came.&nbsp; Besides,
in her establishment, so that the result was good, no one inquired if
the small economies had been observed in the production.&nbsp; Whereas
every penny&mdash;every halfpenny, was of consequence to Miss Galindo;
and visions of squandered drops of milk and wasted crusts of bread filled
her mind with dismay.&nbsp; But she swallowed all her apprehensions
down, out of her regard for Lady Ludlow, and desire to be of service
to her.&nbsp; No one knows how great a trial it was to her when she
thought of Sally, unchecked and unscolded for three hours every morning.&nbsp;
But all she said was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sally, go to the Deuce.&rsquo;&nbsp; I beg your pardon,
my lady, if I was talking to myself; it&rsquo;s a habit I have got into
of keeping my tongue in practice, and I am not quite aware when I do
it.&nbsp; Three hours every morning!&nbsp; I shall be only too proud
to do what I can for your ladyship; and I hope Mr. Horner will not be
too impatient with me at first.&nbsp; You know, perhaps, that I was
nearly being an authoress once, and that seems as if I was destined
to &lsquo;employ my time in writing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; we must return to the subject of the clerkship
afterwards, if you please.&nbsp; An authoress, Miss Galindo!&nbsp; You
surprise me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, indeed, I was.&nbsp; All was quite ready.&nbsp; Doctor
Burney used to teach me music: not that I ever could learn, but it was
a fancy of my poor father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And his daughter wrote a book,
and they said she was but a very young lady, and nothing but a music-master&rsquo;s
daughter; so why should not I try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I got paper and half-a-hundred good pens, a bottle
of ink, all ready&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, it ended in my having nothing to say, when I sat down to
write.&nbsp; But sometimes, when I get hold of a book, I wonder why
I let such a poor reason stop me.&nbsp; It does not others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think it was very well it did, Miss Galindo,&rdquo;
said her ladyship.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am extremely against women usurping
men&rsquo;s employments, as they are very apt to do.&nbsp; But perhaps,
after all, the notion of writing a book improved your hand.&nbsp; It
is one of the most legible I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I despise z&rsquo;s without tails,&rdquo; said Miss Galindo,
with a good deal of gratified pride at my lady&rsquo;s praise.&nbsp;
Presently, my lady took her to look at a curious old cabinet, which
Lord Ludlow had picked up at the Hague; and while they were out of the
room on this errand, I suppose the question of remuneration was settled,
for I heard no more of it.</p>
<p>When they came back, they were talking of Mr. Gray.&nbsp; Miss Galindo
was unsparing in her expressions of opinion about him: going much farther
than my lady&mdash;in her language, at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little blushing man like him, who can&rsquo;t say bo to
a goose without hesitating and colouring, to come to this village&mdash;which
is as good a village as ever lived&mdash;and cry us down for a set of
sinners, as if we had all committed murder and that other thing!&mdash;I
have no patience with him, my lady.&nbsp; And then, how is he to help
us to heaven, by teaching us our, a b, ab&mdash;b a, ba?&nbsp; And yet,
by all accounts, that&rsquo;s to save poor children&rsquo;s souls.&nbsp;
O, I knew your ladyship would agree with me.&nbsp; I am sure my mother
was as good a creature as ever breathed the blessed air; and if she&rsquo;s
not gone to heaven I don&rsquo;t want to go there; and she could not
spell a letter decently.&nbsp; And does Mr. Gray think God took note
of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure you would agree with me, Miss Galindo,&rdquo; said
my lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;You and I can remember how this talk about education&mdash;Rousseau,
and his writings&mdash;stirred up the French people to their Reign of
Terror, and all those bloody scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that Rousseau and Mr. Gray are birds of a
feather,&rdquo; replied Miss Galindo, shaking her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
yet there is some good in the young man too.&nbsp; He sat up all night
with Billy Davis, when his wife was fairly worn out with nursing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he, indeed!&rdquo; said my lady, her face lighting up,
as it always did when she heard of any kind or generous action, no matter
who performed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity he is bitten with these new
revolutionary ideas, and is so much for disturbing the established order
of society!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Miss Galindo went, she left so favourable an impression of her
visit on my lady, that she said to me with a pleased smile&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have provided Mr. Horner with a far better clerk
than he would have made of that lad Gregson in twenty years.&nbsp; And
I will send the lad to my lord&rsquo;s grieve, in Scotland, that he
may be kept out of harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But something happened to the lad before this purpose could be accomplished.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>The next morning, Miss Galindo made her appearance, and, by some
mistake, unusual to my lady&rsquo;s well-trained servants, was shown
into the room where I was trying to walk; for a certain amount of exercise
was prescribed for me, painful although the exertion had become.</p>
<p>She brought a little basket along with her and while the footman
was gone to inquire my lady&rsquo;s wishes (for I don&rsquo;t think
that Lady Ludlow expected Miss Galindo so soon to assume her clerkship;
nor, indeed, had Mr. Horner any work of any kind ready for his new assistant
to do), she launched out into conversation with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a sudden summons, my dear!&nbsp; However, as I have
often said to myself, ever since an occasion long ago, if Lady Ludlow
ever honours me by asking for my right hand, I&rsquo;ll cut it off,
and wrap the stump up so tidily she shall never find out it bleeds.&nbsp;
But, if I had had a little more time, I could have mended my pens better.&nbsp;
You see, I have had to sit up pretty late to get these sleeves made&rdquo;&mdash;and
she took out of her basket a pail of brown-holland over-sleeves, very
much such as a grocer&rsquo;s apprentice wears&mdash;&ldquo;and I had
only time to make seven or eight pens, out of some quills Farmer Thomson
gave me last autumn.&nbsp; As for ink, I&rsquo;m thankful to say, that&rsquo;s
always ready; an ounce of steel filings, an ounce of nut-gall, and a
pint of water (tea, if you&rsquo;re extravagant, which, thank Heaven!
I&rsquo;m not), put all in a bottle, and hang it up behind the house
door, so that the whole gets a good shaking every time you slam it to&mdash;and
even if you are in a passion and bang it, as Sally and I often do, it
is all the better for it&mdash;and there&rsquo;s my ink ready for use;
ready to write my lady&rsquo;s will with, if need be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Miss Galindo!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk so
my lady&rsquo;s will! and she not dead yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she were, what would be the use of talking of making
her will?&nbsp; Now, if you were Sally, I should say, &lsquo;Answer
me that, you goose!&rsquo;&nbsp; But, as you&rsquo;re a relation of
my lady&rsquo;s, I must be civil, and only say, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
think how you can talk so like a fool!&rsquo;&nbsp; To be sure, poor
thing, you&rsquo;re lame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know how long she would have gone on; but my lady came in,
and I, released from my duty of entertaining Miss Galindo, made my limping
way into the next room.&nbsp; To tell the truth, I was rather afraid
of Miss Galindo&rsquo;s tongue, for I never knew what she would say
next.</p>
<p>After a while my lady came, and began to look in the bureau for something:
and as she looked she said&mdash;&ldquo;I think Mr. Horner must have
made some mistake, when he said he had so much work that he almost required
a clerk, for this morning he cannot find anything for Miss Galindo to
do; and there she is, sitting with her pen behind her ear, waiting for
something to write.&nbsp; I am come to find her my mother&rsquo;s letters,
for I should like to have a fair copy made of them.&nbsp; O, here they
are: don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, my dear child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my lady returned again, she sat down and began to talk of Mr.
Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Galindo says she saw him going to hold a prayer-meeting
in a cottage.&nbsp; Now that really makes me unhappy, it is so like
what Mr. Wesley used to do in my younger days; and since then we have
had rebellion in the American colonies and the French Revolution.&nbsp;
You may depend upon it, my dear, making religion and education common&mdash;vulgarising
them, as it were&mdash;is a bad thing for a nation.&nbsp; A man who
hears prayers read in the cottage where he has just supped on bread
and bacon, forgets the respect due to a church: he begins to think that
one place is as good as another, and, by-and-by, that one person is
as good as another; and after that, I always find that people begin
to talk of their rights, instead of thinking of their duties.&nbsp;
I wish Mr. Gray had been more tractable, and had left well alone.&nbsp;
What do you think I heard this morning?&nbsp; Why that the Home Hill
estate, which niches into the Hanbury property, was bought by a Baptist
baker from Birmingham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Baptist baker!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; I had never seen
a Dissenter, to my knowledge; but, having always heard them spoken of
with horror, I looked upon them almost as if they were rhinoceroses.&nbsp;
I wanted to see a live Dissenter, I believe, and yet I wished it were
over.&nbsp; I was almost surprised when I heard that any of them were
engaged in such peaceful occupations as baking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! so Mr. Horner tells me.&nbsp; A Mr. Lambe, I believe.&nbsp;
But, at any rate, he is a Baptist, and has been in trade.&nbsp; What
with his schismatism and Mr. Gray&rsquo;s methodism, I am afraid all
the primitive character of this place will vanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From what I could hear, Mr. Gray seemed to be taking his own way;
at any rate, more than he had done when he first came to the village,
when his natural timidity had made him defer to my lady, and seek her
consent and sanction before embarking in any new plan.&nbsp; But newness
was a quality Lady Ludlow especially disliked.&nbsp; Even in the fashions
of dress and furniture, she clung to the old, to the modes which had
prevailed when she was young; and though she had a deep personal regard
for Queen Charlotte (to whom, as I have already said, she had been maid-of-honour),
yet there was a tinge of Jacobitism about her, such as made her extremely
dislike to hear Prince Charles Edward called the young Pretender, as
many loyal people did in those days, and made her fond of telling of
the thorn-tree in my lord&rsquo;s park in Scotland, which had been planted
by bonny Queen Mary herself, and before which every guest in the Castle
of Monkshaven was expected to stand bare-headed, out of respect to the
memory and misfortunes of the royal planter.</p>
<p>We might play at cards, if we so chose, on a Sunday; at least, I
suppose we might, for my lady and Mr. Mountford used to do so often
when I first went.&nbsp; But we must neither play cards, nor read, nor
sew on the fifth of November and on the thirtieth of January, but must
go to church, and meditate all the rest of the day&mdash;and very hard
work meditating was.&nbsp; I would far rather have scoured a room.&nbsp;
That was the reason, I suppose, why a passive life was seen to be better
discipline for me than an active one.</p>
<p>But I am wandering away from my lady, and her dislike to all innovation.&nbsp;
Now, it seemed to me, as far as I heard, that Mr. Gray was full of nothing
but new things, and that what he first did was to attack all our established
institutions, both in the village and the parish, and also in the nation.&nbsp;
To be sure, I heard of his ways of going on principally from Miss Galindo,
who was apt to speak more strongly than accurately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;clucking up the children
just like an old hen, and trying to teach them about their salvation
and their souls, and I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;things that it is
just blasphemy to speak about out of church.&nbsp; And he potters old
people about reading their Bibles.&nbsp; I am sure I don&rsquo;t want
to speak disrespectfully about the Holy Scriptures, but I found old
Job Horton busy reading his Bible yesterday.&nbsp; Says I, &lsquo;What
are you reading, and where did you get it, and who gave it you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
So he made answer, &lsquo;That he was reading Susannah and the Elders,
for that he had read Bel and the Dragon till he could pretty near say
it off by heart, and they were two as pretty stories as ever he had
read, and that it was a caution to him what bad old chaps there were
in the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, as Job is bed-ridden, I don&rsquo;t
think he is likely to meet with the Elders, and I say that I think repeating
his Creed, the Commandments, and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and, maybe,
throwing in a verse of the Psalms, if he wanted a bit of a change, would
have done him far more good than his pretty stories, as he called them.&nbsp;
And what&rsquo;s the next thing our young parson does?&nbsp; Why he
tries to make us all feel pitiful for the black slaves, and leaves little
pictures of negroes about, with the question printed below, &lsquo;Am
I not a man and a brother?&rsquo; just as if I was to be hail-fellow-well-met
with every negro footman.&nbsp; They do say he takes no sugar in his
tea, because he thinks he sees spots of blood in it.&nbsp; Now I call
that superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day it was a still worse story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear! and how are you?&nbsp; My lady sent me in to
sit a bit with you, while Mr. Horner looks out some papers for me to
copy.&nbsp; Between ourselves, Mr. Steward Horner does not like having
me for a clerk.&nbsp; It is all very well he does not; for, if he were
decently civil to me, I might want a chaperone, you know, now poor Mrs.
Horner is dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was one of Miss Galindo&rsquo;s grim
jokes.&nbsp; &ldquo;As it is, I try to make him forget I&rsquo;m a woman,
I do everything as ship-shape as a masculine man-clerk.&nbsp; I see
he can&rsquo;t find a fault&mdash;writing good, spelling correct, sums
all right.&nbsp; And then he squints up at me with the tail of his eye,
and looks glummer than ever, just because I&rsquo;m a woman&mdash;as
if I could help that.&nbsp; I have gone good lengths to set his mind
at ease.&nbsp; I have stuck my pen behind my ear, I have made him a
bow instead of a curtsey, I have whistled&mdash;not a tune I can&rsquo;t
pipe up that&mdash;nay, if you won&rsquo;t tell my lady, I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you that I have said &lsquo;Confound it!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Zounds!&rsquo;&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t get any farther.&nbsp; For all that, Mr. Horner won&rsquo;t
forget I am a lady, and so I am not half the use I might be, and if
it were not to please my Lady Ludlow, Mr. Horner and his books might
go hang (see how natural that came out!).&nbsp; And there is an order
for a dozen nightcaps for a bride, and I am so afraid I shan&rsquo;t
have time to do them.&nbsp; Worst of all, there&rsquo;s Mr. Gray taking
advantage of my absence to seduce Sally!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To seduce Sally!&nbsp; Mr. Gray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, child!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a kind of seduction.&nbsp;
Mr. Gray is seducing Sally to want to go to church.&nbsp; There has
he been twice at my house, while I have been away in the mornings, talking
to Sally about the state of her soul and that sort of thing.&nbsp; But
when I found the meat all roasted to a cinder, I said, &lsquo;Come,
Sally, let&rsquo;s have no more praying when beef is down at the fire.&nbsp;
Pray at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning and nine at night, and I won&rsquo;t
hinder you.&rsquo;&nbsp; So she sauced me, and said something about
Martha and Mary, implying that, because she had let the beef get so
overdone that I declare I could hardly find a bit for Nancy Pole&rsquo;s
sick grandchild, she had chosen the better part.&nbsp; I was very much
put about, I own, and perhaps you&rsquo;ll be shocked at what I said&mdash;indeed,
I don&rsquo;t know if it was right myself&mdash;but I told her I had
a soul as well as she, and if it was to be saved by my sitting still
and thinking about salvation and never doing my duty, I thought I had
as good a right as she had to be Mary, and save my soul.&nbsp; So, that
afternoon I sat quite still, and it was really a comfort, for I am often
too busy, I know, to pray as I ought.&nbsp; There is first one person
wanting me, and then another, and the house and the food and the neighbours
to see after.&nbsp; So, when tea-time comes, there enters my maid with
her hump on her back, and her soul to be saved.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please,
ma&rsquo;am, did you order the pound of butter?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No,
Sally,&rsquo; I said, shaking my head, &lsquo;this morning I did not
go round by Hale&rsquo;s farm, and this afternoon I have been employed
in spiritual things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, our Sally likes tea and bread-and-butter above everything,
and dry bread was not to her taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m thankful,&rsquo; said the impudent hussy,
&lsquo;that you have taken a turn towards godliness.&nbsp; It will be
my prayers, I trust, that&rsquo;s given it you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was determined not to give her an opening towards the carnal
subject of butter, so she lingered still, longing to ask leave to run
for it.&nbsp; But I gave her none, and munched my dry bread myself,
thinking what a famous cake I could make for little Ben Pole with the
bit of butter we were saving; and when Sally had had her butterless
tea, and was in none of the best of tempers because Martha had not bethought
herself of the butter, I just quietly said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Sally, to-morrow we&rsquo;ll try to hash that
beef well, and to remember the butter, and to work out our salvation
all at the same time, for I don&rsquo;t see why it can&rsquo;t all be
done, as God has set us to do it all.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I heard her at
it again about Mary and Martha, and I have no doubt that Mr. Gray will
teach her to consider me a lost sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had heard so many little speeches about Mr. Gray from one person
or another, all speaking against him, as a mischief-maker, a setter-up
of new doctrines, and of a fanciful standard of life (and you may be
sure that, where Lady Ludlow led, Mrs. Medlicott and Adams were certain
to follow, each in their different ways showing the influence my lady
had over them), that I believe I had grown to consider him as a very
instrument of evil, and to expect to perceive in his face marks of his
presumption, and arrogance, and impertinent interference.&nbsp; It was
now many weeks since I had seen him, and when he was one morning shown
into the blue drawing-room (into which I had been removed for a change),
I was quite surprised to see how innocent and awkward a young man he
appeared, confused even more than I was at our unexpected t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.&nbsp;
He looked thinner, his eyes more eager, his expression more anxious,
and his colour came and went more than it had done when I had seen him
last.&nbsp; I tried to make a little conversation, as I was, to my own
surprise, more at my ease than he was; but his thoughts were evidently
too much preoccupied for him to do more than answer me with monosyllables.</p>
<p>Presently my lady came in.&nbsp; Mr. Gray twitched and coloured more
than ever; but plunged into the middle of his subject at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady, I cannot answer it to my conscience, if I allow the
children of this village to go on any longer the little heathens that
they are.&nbsp; I must do something to alter their condition.&nbsp;
I am quite aware that your ladyship disapproves of many of the plans
which have suggested themselves to me; but nevertheless I must do something,
and I am come now to your ladyship to ask respectfully, but firmly,
what you would advise me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes were dilated, and I could almost have said they were full
of tears with his eagerness.&nbsp; But I am sure it is a bad plan to
remind people of decided opinions which they have once expressed, if
you wish them to modify those opinions.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Gray had done
this with my lady; and though I do not mean to say she was obstinate,
yet she was not one to retract.</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment or two before she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me to suggest a remedy for an evil of the existence
of which I am not conscious,&rdquo; was her answer&mdash;very coldly,
very gently given.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Mr. Mountford&rsquo;s time I heard
no such complaints: whenever I see the village children (and they are
not unfrequent visitors at this house, on one pretext or another), they
are well and decently behaved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, madam, you cannot judge,&rdquo; he broke in.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are trained to respect you in word and deed; you are the highest they
ever look up to; they have no notion of a higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said my lady, smiling, &ldquo;they are
as loyally disposed as any children can be.&nbsp; They come up here
every fourth of June, and drink his Majesty&rsquo;s health, and have
buns, and (as Margaret Dawson can testify) they take a great and respectful
interest in all the pictures I can show them of the royal family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, madam, I think of something higher than any earthly dignities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady coloured at the mistake she had made; for she herself was
truly pious.&nbsp; Yet when she resumed the subject, it seemed to me
as if her tone was a little sharper than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such want of reverence is, I should say, the clergyman&rsquo;s
fault.&nbsp; You must excuse me, Mr. Gray, if I speak plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lady, I want plain-speaking.&nbsp; I myself am not accustomed
to those ceremonies and forms which are, I suppose, the etiquette in
your ladyship&rsquo;s rank of life, and which seem to hedge you in from
any power of mine to touch you.&nbsp; Among those with whom I have passed
my life hitherto, it has been the custom to speak plainly out what we
have felt earnestly.&nbsp; So, instead of needing any apology from your
ladyship for straightforward speaking, I will meet what you say at once,
and admit that it is the clergyman&rsquo;s fault, in a great measure,
when the children of his parish swear, and curse, and are brutal, and
ignorant of all saving grace; nay, some of them of the very name of
God.&nbsp; And because this guilt of mine, as the clergyman of this
parish, lies heavy on my soul, and every day leads but from bad to worse,
till I am utterly bewildered how to do good to children who escape from
me as if I were a monster, and who are growing up to be men fit for
and capable of any crime, but those requiring wit or sense, I come to
you, who seem to me all-powerful, as far as material power goes&mdash;for
your ladyship only knows the surface of things, and barely that, that
pass in your village&mdash;to help me with advice, and such outward
help as you can give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray had stood up and sat down once or twice while he had been
speaking, in an agitated, nervous kind of way, and now he was interrupted
by a violent fit of coughing, after which he trembled all over.</p>
<p>My lady rang for a glass of water, and looked much distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am sure you are not well;
and that makes you exaggerate childish faults into positive evils.&nbsp;
It is always the case with us when we are not strong in health.&nbsp;
I hear of your exerting yourself in every direction: you overwork yourself,
and the consequence is, that you imagine us all worse people than we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And my lady smiled very kindly and pleasantly at him, as he sat,
a little panting, a little flushed, trying to recover his breath.&nbsp;
I am sure that now they were brought face to face, she had quite forgotten
all the offence she had taken at his doings when she heard of them from
others; and, indeed, it was enough to soften any one&rsquo;s heart to
see that young, almost boyish face, looking in such anxiety and distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lady, what shall I do?&rdquo; he asked, as soon as
he could recover breath, and with such an air of humility, that I am
sure no one who had seen it could have ever thought him conceited again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The evil of this world is too strong for me.&nbsp; I can do so
little.&nbsp; It is all in vain.&nbsp; It was only to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
and again the cough and agitation returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said my lady (the day before I could
never have believed she could have called him My dear), &ldquo;you must
take the advice of an old woman about yourself.&nbsp; You are not fit
to do anything just now but attend to your own health: rest, and see
a doctor (but, indeed, I will take care of that), and when you are pretty
strong again, you will find that you have been magnifying evils to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my lady, I cannot rest.&nbsp; The evils do exist, and
the burden of their continuance lies on my shoulders.&nbsp; I have no
place to gather the children together in, that I may teach them the
things necessary to salvation.&nbsp; The rooms in my own house are too
small; but I have tried them.&nbsp; I have money of my own; and, as
your ladyship knows, I tried to get a piece of leasehold property, on
which to build a school-house at my own expense.&nbsp; Your ladyship&rsquo;s
lawyer comes forward, at your instructions, to enforce some old feudal
right, by which no building is allowed on leasehold property without
the sanction of the lady of the manor.&nbsp; It may be all very true;
but it was a cruel thing to do,&mdash;that is, if your ladyship had
known (which I am sure you do not) the real moral and spiritual state
of my poor parishioners.&nbsp; And now I come to you to know what I
am to do.&nbsp; Rest!&nbsp; I cannot rest, while children whom I could
possibly save are being left in their ignorance, their blasphemy, their
uncleanness, their cruelty.&nbsp; It is known through the village that
your ladyship disapproves of my efforts, and opposes all my plans.&nbsp;
If you think them wrong, foolish, ill-digested (I have been a student,
living in a college, and eschewing all society but that of pious men,
until now: I may not judge for the best, in my ignorance of this sinful
human nature), tell me of better plans and wiser projects for accomplishing
my end; but do not bid me rest, with Satan compassing me round, and
stealing souls away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray,&rdquo; said my lady, &ldquo;there may be some truth
in what you have said.&nbsp; I do not deny it, though I think, in your
present state of indisposition and excitement, you exaggerate it much.&nbsp;
I believe&mdash;nay, the experience of a pretty long life has convinced
me&mdash;that education is a bad thing, if given indiscriminately.&nbsp;
It unfits the lower orders for their duties, the duties to which they
are called by God; of submission to those placed in authority over them;
of contentment with that state of life to which it has pleased God to
call them, and of ordering themselves lowly and reverently to all their
betters.&nbsp; I have made this conviction of mine tolerably evident
to you; and I have expressed distinctly my disapprobation of some of
your ideas.&nbsp; You may imagine, then, that I was not well pleased
when I found that you had taken a rood or more of Farmer Hale&rsquo;s
land, and were laying the foundations of a school-house.&nbsp; You had
done this without asking for my permission, which, as Farmer Hale&rsquo;s
liege lady, ought to have been obtained legally, as well as asked for
out of courtesy.&nbsp; I put a stop to what I believed to be calculated
to do harm to a village, to a population in which, to say the least
of it, I may be disposed to take as much interest as you can do.&nbsp;
How can reading, and writing, and the multiplication-table (if you choose
to go so far) prevent blasphemy, and uncleanness, and cruelty?&nbsp;
Really, Mr. Gray, I hardly like to express myself so strongly on the
subject in your present state of health, as I should do at any other
time.&nbsp; It seems to me that books do little; character much; and
character is not formed from books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think of character: I think of souls.&nbsp; I must
get some hold upon these children, or what will become of them in the
next world?&nbsp; I must be found to have some power beyond what they
have, and which they are rendered capable of appreciating, before they
will listen to me.&nbsp; At present physical force is all they look
up to; and I have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Mr. Gray, by your own admission, they look up to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would not do anything your ladyship disliked if it was
likely to come to your knowledge; but if they could conceal it from
you, the knowledge of your dislike to a particular line of conduct would
never make them cease from pursuing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray&rdquo;&mdash;surprise in her air, and some little
indignation&mdash;&ldquo;they and their fathers have lived on the Hanbury
lands for generations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it, madam.&nbsp; I am telling you the truth,
whether you believe me or not.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a pause; my lady
looked perplexed, and somewhat ruffled; Mr. Gray as though hopeless
and wearied out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, my lady,&rdquo; said he, at last,
rising as he spoke, &ldquo;you can suggest nothing to ameliorate the
state of things which, I do assure you, does exist on your lands, and
among your tenants.&nbsp; Surely, you will not object to my using Farmer
Hale&rsquo;s great barn every Sabbath?&nbsp; He will allow me the use
of it, if your ladyship will grant your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fit for any extra work at present,&rdquo; (and
indeed he had been coughing very much all through the conversation).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give me time to consider of it.&nbsp; Tell me what you wish to
teach.&nbsp; You will be able to take care of your health, and grow
stronger while I consider.&nbsp; It shall not be the worse for you,
if you leave it in my hands for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady spoke very kindly; but he was in too excited a state to recognize
the kindness, while the idea of delay was evidently a sore irritation.&nbsp;
I heard him say: &ldquo;And I have so little time in which to do my
work.&nbsp; Lord! lay not this sin to my charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my lady was speaking to the old butler, for whom, at her sign,
I had rung the bell some little time before.&nbsp; Now she turned round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray, I find I have some bottles of Malmsey, of the vintage
of seventeen hundred and seventy-eight, yet left.&nbsp; Malmsey, as
perhaps you know, used to be considered a specific for coughs arising
from weakness.&nbsp; You must permit me to send you half-a-dozen bottles,
and, depend upon it, you will take a more cheerful view of life and
its duties before you have finished them, especially if you will be
so kind as to see Dr. Trevor, who is coming to see me in the course
of the week.&nbsp; By the time you are strong enough to work, I will
try and find some means of preventing the children from using such bad
language, and otherwise annoying you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady, it is the sin, and not the annoyance.&nbsp; I wish
I could make you understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke with some impatience;
Poor fellow! he was too weak, exhausted, and nervous.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am perfectly well; I can set to work to-morrow; I will do anything not
to be oppressed with the thought of how little I am doing.&nbsp; I do
not want your wine.&nbsp; Liberty to act in the manner I think right,
will do me far more good.&nbsp; But it is of no use.&nbsp; It is preordained
that I am to be nothing but a cumberer of the ground.&nbsp; I beg your
ladyship&rsquo;s pardon for this call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up, and then turned dizzy.&nbsp; My lady looked on, deeply
hurt, and not a little offended, he held out his hand to her, and I
could see that she had a little hesitation before she took it.&nbsp;
He then saw me, I almost think, for the first time; and put out his
hand once more, drew it back, as if undecided, put it out again, and
finally took hold of mine for an instant in his damp, listless hand,
and was gone.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow was dissatisfied with both him and herself, I was sure.&nbsp;
Indeed, I was dissatisfied with the result of the interview myself.&nbsp;
But my lady was not one to speak out her feelings on the subject; nor
was I one to forget myself, and begin on a topic which she did not begin.&nbsp;
She came to me, and was very tender with me; so tender, that that, and
the thoughts of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s sick, hopeless, disappointed look,
nearly made me cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired, little one,&rdquo; said my lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
and lie down in my room, and hear what Medlicott and I can decide upon
in the way of strengthening dainties for that poor young man, who is
killing himself with his over-sensitive conscientiousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lady!&rdquo; said I, and then I stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&nbsp; What?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would but let him have Farmer Hale&rsquo;s barn at
once, it would do him more good than all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, child!&rdquo; though I don&rsquo;t think she was
displeased, &ldquo;he is not fit for more work just now.&nbsp; I shall
go and write for Dr. Trevor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for the next half-hour, we did nothing but arrange physical comforts
and cures for poor Mr. Gray.&nbsp; At the end of the time, Mrs. Medlicott
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your ladyship heard that Harry Gregson has fallen from
a tree, and broken his thigh-bone, and is like to be a cripple for life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Gregson!&nbsp; That black-eyed lad who read my letter?&nbsp;
It all comes from over-education!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see how my lady could think it was over-education
that made Harry Gregson break his thigh, for the manner in which he
met with the accident was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Horner, who had fallen sadly out of health since his wife&rsquo;s
death, had attached himself greatly to Harry Gregson.&nbsp; Now, Mr.
Horner had a cold manner to every one, and never spoke more than was
necessary, at the best of times.&nbsp; And, latterly, it had not been
the best of times with him.&nbsp; I dare say, he had had some causes
for anxiety (of which I knew nothing) about my lady&rsquo;s affairs;
and he was evidently annoyed by my lady&rsquo;s whim (as he once inadvertently
called it) of placing Miss Galindo under him in the position of a clerk.&nbsp;
Yet he had always been friends, in his quiet way, with Miss Galindo,
and she devoted herself to her new occupation with diligence and punctuality,
although more than once she had moaned to me over the orders for needlework
which had been sent to her, and which, owing to her occupation in the
service of Lady Ludlow, she had been unable to fulfil.</p>
<p>The only living creature to whom the staid Mr. Horner could be said
to be attached, was Harry Gregson.&nbsp; To my lady he was a faithful
and devoted servant, looking keenly after her interests, and anxious
to forward them at any cost of trouble to himself.&nbsp; But the more
shrewd Mr. Horner was, the more probability was there of his being annoyed
at certain peculiarities of opinion which my lady held with a quiet,
gentle pertinacity; against which no arguments, based on mere worldly
and business calculations, made any way.&nbsp; This frequent opposition
to views which Mr. Horner entertained, although it did not interfere
with the sincere respect which the lady and the steward felt for each
other, yet prevented any warmer feeling of affection from coming in.&nbsp;
It seems strange to say it, but I must repeat it&mdash;the only person
for whom, since his wife&rsquo;s death, Mr. Horner seemed to feel any
love, was the little imp Harry Gregson, with his bright, watchful eyes,
his tangled hair hanging right down to his eyebrows, for all the world
like a Skye terrier.&nbsp; This lad, half gipsy and whole poacher, as
many people esteemed him, hung about the silent, respectable, staid
Mr. Horner, and followed his steps with something of the affectionate
fidelity of the dog which he resembled.&nbsp; I suspect, this demonstration
of attachment to his person on Harry Gregson&rsquo;s part was what won
Mr. Horner&rsquo;s regard.&nbsp; In the first instance, the steward
had only chosen the lad out as the cleverest instrument he could find
for his purpose; and I don&rsquo;t mean to say that, if Harry had not
been almost as shrewd as Mr. Horner himself was, both by original disposition
and subsequent experience, the steward would have taken to him as he
did, let the lad have shown ever so much affection for him.</p>
<p>But even to Harry Mr. Horner was silent.&nbsp; Still, it was pleasant
to find himself in many ways so readily understood; to perceive that
the crumbs of knowledge he let fall were picked up by his little follower,
and hoarded like gold that here was one to hate the persons and things
whom Mr. Horner coldly disliked, and to reverence and admire all those
for whom he had any regard.&nbsp; Mr. Horner had never had a child,
and unconsciously, I suppose, something of the paternal feeling had
begun to develop itself in him towards Harry Gregson.&nbsp; I heard
one or two things from different people, which have always made me fancy
that Mr. Horner secretly and almost unconsciously hoped that Harry Gregson
might be trained so as to be first his clerk, and next his assistant,
and finally his successor in his stewardship to the Hanbury estates.</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s disgrace with my lady, in consequence of his reading
the letter, was a deeper blow to Mr. Horner than his quiet manner would
ever have led any one to suppose, or than Lady Ludlow ever dreamed of
inflicting, I am sure.</p>
<p>Probably Harry had a short, stern rebuke from Mr. Horner at the time,
for his manner was always hard even to those he cared for the most.&nbsp;
But Harry&rsquo;s love was not to be daunted or quelled by a few sharp
words.&nbsp; I dare say, from what I heard of them afterwards, that
Harry accompanied Mr. Horner in his walk over the farm the very day
of the rebuke; his presence apparently unnoticed by the agent, by whom
his absence would have been painfully felt nevertheless.&nbsp; That
was the way of it, as I have been told.&nbsp; Mr. Horner never bade
Harry go with him; never thanked him for going, or being at his heels
ready to run on any errands, straight as the crow flies to his point,
and back to heel in as short a time as possible.&nbsp; Yet, if Harry
were away, Mr. Horner never inquired the reason from any of the men
who might be supposed to know whether he was detained by his father,
or otherwise engaged; he never asked Harry himself where he had been.&nbsp;
But Miss Galindo said that those labourers who knew Mr. Horner well,
told her that he was always more quick-eyed to shortcomings, more savage-like
in fault-finding, on those days when the lad was absent.</p>
<p>Miss Galindo, indeed, was my great authority for most of the village
news which I heard.&nbsp; She it was who gave me the particulars of
poor Harry&rsquo;s accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the little poacher
has taken some unaccountable fancy to my master.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This
was the name by which Miss Galindo always spoke of Mr. Horner to me,
ever since she had been, as she called it, appointed his clerk.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if I had twenty hearts to lose, I never could spare a
bit of one of them for that good, gray, square, severe man.&nbsp; But
different people have different tastes, and here is that little imp
of a gipsy-tinker ready to turn slave for my master; and, odd enough,
my master,&mdash;who, I should have said beforehand, would have made
short work of imp, and imp&rsquo;s family, and have sent Hall, the Bang-beggar,
after them in no time&mdash;my master, as they tell me, is in his way
quite fond of the lad, and if he could, without vexing my lady too much,
he would have made him what the folks here call a Latiner.&nbsp; However,
last night, it seems that there was a letter of some importance forgotten
(I can&rsquo;t tell you what it was about, my dear, though I know perfectly
well, but &lsquo;<i>service oblige</i>,&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;noblesse,&rsquo;
and you must take my word for it that it was important, and one that
I am surprised my master could forget), till too late for the post.&nbsp;
(The poor, good, orderly man is not what he was before his wife&rsquo;s
death.)&nbsp; Well, it seems that he was sore annoyed by his forgetfulness,
and well he might be.&nbsp; And it was all the more vexatious, as he
had no one to blame but himself.&nbsp; As for that matter, I always
scold somebody else when I&rsquo;m in fault; but I suppose my master
would never think of doing that, else it&rsquo;s a mighty relief.&nbsp;
However, he could eat no tea, and was altogether put out and gloomy.&nbsp;
And the little faithful imp-lad, perceiving all this, I suppose, got
up like a page in an old ballad, and said he would run for his life
across country to Comberford, and see if he could not get there before
the bags were made up.&nbsp; So my master gave him the letter, and nothing
more was heard of the poor fellow till this morning, for the father
thought his son was sleeping in Mr. Horner&rsquo;s barn, as he does
occasionally, it seems, and my master, as was very natural, that he
had gone to his father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he had fallen down the old stone quarry, had he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure enough.&nbsp; Mr. Gray had been up here fretting
my lady with some of his new-fangled schemes, and because the young
man could not have it all his own way, from what I understand, he was
put out, and thought he would go home by the back lane, instead of through
the village, where the folks would notice if the parson looked glum.&nbsp;
But, however, it was a mercy, and I don&rsquo;t mind saying so, ay,
and meaning it too, though it may be like methodism; for, as Mr. Gray
walked by the quarry, he heard a groan, and at first he thought it was
a lamb fallen down; and he stood still, and then he heard it again;
and then I suppose, he looked down and saw Harry.&nbsp; So he let himself
down by the boughs of the trees to the ledge where Harry lay half-dead,
and with his poor thigh broken.&nbsp; There he had lain ever since the
night before: he had been returning to tell the master that he had safely
posted the letter, and the first words he said, when they recovered
him from the exhausted state he was in, were&rdquo; (Miss Galindo tried
hard not to whimper, as she said it), &ldquo;&lsquo;It was in time,
sir.&nbsp; I see&rsquo;d it put in the bag with my own eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is he?&rdquo; asked I.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did Mr.
Gray get him out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! there it is, you see.&nbsp; Why the old gentleman (I daren&rsquo;t
say Devil in Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s house) is not so black as he is painted;
and Mr. Gray must have a deal of good in him, as I say at times; and
then at others, when he has gone against me, I can&rsquo;t bear him,
and think hanging too good for him.&nbsp; But he lifted the poor lad,
as if he had been a baby, I suppose, and carried him up the great ledges
that were formerly used for steps; and laid him soft and easy on the
wayside grass, and ran home and got help and a door, and had him carried
to his house, and laid on his bed; and then somehow, for the first time
either he or any one else perceived it, he himself was all over blood&mdash;his
own blood&mdash;he had broken a blood-vessel; and there he lies in the
little dressing-room, as white and as still as if he were dead; and
the little imp in Mr. Gray&rsquo;s own bed, sound asleep, now his leg
is set, just as if linen sheets and a feather bed were his native element,
as one may say.&nbsp; Really, now he is doing so well, I&rsquo;ve no
patience with him, lying there where Mr. Gray ought to be.&nbsp; It
is just what my lady always prophesied would come to pass, if there
was any confusion of ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Gray!&rdquo; said I, thinking of his flushed face,
and his feverish, restless ways, when he had been calling on my lady
not an hour before his exertions on Harry&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; And
I told Miss Galindo how ill I had thought him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that was the reason
my lady had sent for Doctor Trevor.&nbsp; Well, it has fallen out admirably,
for he looked well after that old donkey of a Prince, and saw that he
made no blunders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now &ldquo;that old donkey of a Prince&rdquo; meant the village surgeon,
Mr. Prince, between whom and Miss Galindo there was war to the knife,
as they often met in the cottages, when there was illness, and she had
her queer, odd recipes, which he, with his grand pharmacopoeia, held
in infinite contempt, and the consequence of their squabbling had been,
not long before this very time, that he had established a kind of rule,
that into whatever sick-room Miss Galindo was admitted, there he refused
to visit.&nbsp; But Miss Galindo&rsquo;s prescriptions and visits cost
nothing and were often backed by kitchen-physic; so, though it was true
that she never came but she scolded about something or other, she was
generally preferred as medical attendant to Mr. Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the old donkey is obliged to tolerate me, and be civil
to me; for, you see, I got there first, and had possession, as it were,
and yet my lord the donkey likes the credit of attending the parson,
and being in consultation with so grand a county-town doctor as Doctor
Trevor.&nbsp; And Doctor Trevor is an old friend of mine&rdquo; (she
sighed a little, some time I may tell you why), &ldquo;and treats me
with infinite bowing and respect; so the donkey, not to be out of medical
fashion, bows too, though it is sadly against the grain; and he pulled
a face as if he had heard a slate-pencil gritting against a slate, when
I told Doctor Trevor I meant to sit up with the two lads, for I call
Mr. Gray little more than a lad, and a pretty conceited one, too, at
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you sit up, Miss Galindo?&nbsp; It will tire
you sadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it.&nbsp; You see, there is Gregson&rsquo;s mother to
keep quiet for she sits by her lad, fretting and sobbing, so that I&rsquo;m
afraid of her disturbing Mr. Gray; and there&rsquo;s Mr. Gray to keep
quiet, for Doctor Trevor says his life depends on it; and there is medicine
to be given to the one, and bandages to be attended to for the other;
and the wild horde of gipsy brothers and sisters to be turned out, and
the father to be held in from showing too much gratitude to Mr. Gray,
who can&rsquo;t hear it,&mdash;and who is to do it all but me?&nbsp;
The only servant is old lame Betty, who once lived with me, and <i>would</i>
leave me because she said I was always bothering&mdash;(there was a
good deal of truth in what she said, I grant, but she need not have
said it; a good deal of truth is best let alone at the bottom of the
well), and what can she do,&mdash;deaf as ever she can be, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Miss Galindo went her ways; but not the less was she at her post
in the morning; a little crosser and more silent than usual; but the
first was not to be wondered at, and the last was rather a blessing.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow had been extremely anxious both about Mr. Gray and Harry
Gregson.&nbsp; Kind and thoughtful in any case of illness and accident,
she always was; but somehow, in this, the feeling that she was not quite&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;&ldquo;friends&rdquo; seems hardly the right
word to use, as to the possible feeling between the Countess Ludlow
and the little vagabond messenger, who had only once been in her presence,&mdash;that
she had hardly parted from either as she could have wished to do, had
death been near, made her more than usually anxious.&nbsp; Doctor Trevor
was not to spare obtaining the best medical advice the county could
afford: whatever he ordered in the way of diet, was to be prepared under
Mrs. Medlicott&rsquo;s own eye, and sent down from the Hall to the Parsonage.&nbsp;
As Mr. Horner had given somewhat similar directions, in the case of
Harry Gregson at least, there was rather a multiplicity of counsellors
and dainties, than any lack of them.&nbsp; And, the second night, Mr.
Horner insisted on taking the superintendence of the nursing himself,
and sat and snored by Harry&rsquo;s bedside, while the poor, exhausted
mother lay by her child,&mdash;thinking that she watched him, but in
reality fast asleep, as Miss Galindo told us; for, distrusting any one&rsquo;s
powers of watching and nursing but her own, she had stolen across the
quiet village street in cloak and dressing-gown, and found Mr. Gray
in vain trying to reach the cup of barley-water which Mr. Horner had
placed just beyond his reach.</p>
<p>In consequence of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s illness, we had to have a strange
curate to do duty; a man who dropped his h&rsquo;s, and hurried through
the service, and yet had time enough to stand in my Lady&rsquo;s way,
bowing to her as she came out of church, and so subservient in manner,
that I believe that sooner than remain unnoticed by a countess, he would
have preferred being scolded, or even cuffed.&nbsp; Now I found out,
that great as was my lady&rsquo;s liking and approval of respect, nay,
even reverence, being paid to her as a person of quality,&mdash;a sort
of tribute to her Order, which she had no individual right to remit,
or, indeed, not to exact,&mdash;yet she, being personally simple, sincere,
and holding herself in low esteem, could not endure anything like the
servility of Mr. Crosse, the temporary curate.&nbsp; She grew absolutely
to loathe his perpetual smiling and bowing; his instant agreement with
the slightest opinion she uttered; his veering round as she blew the
wind.&nbsp; I have often said that my lady did not talk much, as she
might have done had she lived among her equals.&nbsp; But we all loved
her so much, that we had learnt to interpret all her little ways pretty
truly; and I knew what particular turns of her head, and contractions
of her delicate fingers meant, as well as if she had expressed herself
in words.&nbsp; I began to suspect that my lady would be very thankful
to have Mr. Gray about again, and doing his duty even with a conscientiousness
that might amount to worrying himself, and fidgeting others; and although
Mr. Gray might hold her opinions in as little esteem as those of any
simple gentlewoman, she was too sensible not to feel how much flavour
there was in his conversation, compared to that of Mr. Crosse, who was
only her tasteless echo.</p>
<p>As for Miss Galindo, she was utterly and entirely a partisan of Mr.
Gray&rsquo;s, almost ever since she had begun to nurse him during his
illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I never set up for reasonableness, my lady.&nbsp;
So I don&rsquo;t pretend to say, as I might do if I were a sensible
woman and all that,&mdash;that I am convinced by Mr. Gray&rsquo;s arguments
of this thing or t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; For one thing, you see, poor fellow!
he has never been able to argue, or hardly indeed to speak, for Doctor
Trevor has been very peremptory.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s been no scope
for arguing!&nbsp; But what I mean is this:&mdash;When I see a sick
man thinking always of others, and never of himself; patient, humble&mdash;a
trifle too much at times, for I&rsquo;ve caught him praying to be forgiven
for having neglected his work as a parish priest,&rdquo; (Miss Galindo
was making horrible faces, to keep back tears, squeezing up her eyes
in a way which would have amused me at any other time, but when she
was speaking of Mr. Gray); &ldquo;when I see a downright good, religious
man, I&rsquo;m apt to think he&rsquo;s got hold of the right clue, and
that I can do no better than hold on by the tails of his coat and shut
my eyes, if we&rsquo;ve got to go over doubtful places on our road to
Heaven.&nbsp; So, my lady, you must excuse me if, when he gets about
again, he is all agog about a Sunday-school, for if he is, I shall be
agog too, and perhaps twice as bad as him, for, you see, I&rsquo;ve
a strong constitution compared to his, and strong ways of speaking and
acting.&nbsp; And I tell your ladyship this now, because I think from
your rank&mdash;and still more, if I may say so, for all your kindness
to me long ago, down to this very day&mdash;you&rsquo;ve a right to
be first told of anything about me.&nbsp; Change of opinion I can&rsquo;t
exactly call it, for I don&rsquo;t see the good of schools and teaching
A B C, any more than I did before, only Mr. Gray does, so I&rsquo;m
to shut my eyes, and leap over the ditch to the side of education.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve told Sally already, that if she does not mind her work, but
stands gossiping with Nelly Mather, I&rsquo;ll teach her her lessons;
and I&rsquo;ve never caught her with old Nelly since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think Miss Galindo&rsquo;s desertion to Mr. Gray&rsquo;s opinions
in this matter hurt my lady just a little bit; but she only said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if the parishoners wish for it, Mr. Gray must have
his Sunday-school.&nbsp; I shall, in that case, withdraw my opposition.&nbsp;
I am sorry I cannot alter my opinions as easily as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady made herself smile as she said this.&nbsp; Miss Galindo saw
it was an effort to do so.&nbsp; She thought a minute before she spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship has not seen Mr. Gray as intimately as I have
done.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one thing.&nbsp; But, as for the parishioners,
they will follow your ladyship&rsquo;s lead in everything; so there
is no chance of their wishing for a Sunday-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never done anything to make them follow my lead, as
you call it, Miss Galindo,&rdquo; said my lady, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; replied Miss Galindo, bluntly.&nbsp;
And then, correcting herself, she said, &ldquo;Begging your ladyship&rsquo;s
pardon, you have.&nbsp; Your ancestors have lived here time out of mind,
and have owned the land on which their forefathers have lived ever since
there were forefathers.&nbsp; You yourself were born amongst them, and
have been like a little queen to them ever since, I might say, and they&rsquo;ve
never known your ladyship do anything but what was kind and gentle;
but I&rsquo;ll leave fine speeches about your ladyship to Mr. Crosse.&nbsp;
Only you, my lady, lead the thoughts of the parish; and save some of
them a world of trouble, for they could never tell what was right if
they had to think for themselves.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all quite right that
they should be guided by you, my lady,&mdash;if only you would agree
with Mr. Gray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my lady, &ldquo;I told him only the last
day that he was here, that I would think about it.&nbsp; I do believe
I could make up my mind on certain subjects better if I were left alone,
than while being constantly talked to about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady said this in her usual soft tones; but the words had a tinge
of impatience about them; indeed, she was more ruffled than I had often
seen her; but, checking herself in an instant she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how Mr. Horner drags in this subject
of education apropos of everything.&nbsp; Not that he says much about
it at any time: it is not his way.&nbsp; But he cannot let the thing
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know why, my lady,&rdquo; said Miss Galindo.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
poor lad, Harry Gregson, will never be able to earn his livelihood in
any active way, but will be lame for life.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Horner thinks
more of Harry than of any one else in the world,&mdash;except, perhaps,
your ladyship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was it not a pretty companionship for my
lady?&nbsp; &ldquo;And he has schemes of his own for teaching Harry;
and if Mr. Gray could but have his school, Mr. Horner and he think Harry
might be schoolmaster, as your ladyship would not like to have him coming
to you as steward&rsquo;s clerk.&nbsp; I wish your ladyship would fall
into this plan; Mr. Gray has it so at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Galindo looked wistfully at my lady, as she said this.&nbsp;
But my lady only said, drily, and rising at the same time, as if to
end the conversation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Horner and Mr. Gray seem to have gone a long way in
advance of my consent to their plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Galindo, as my lady left the
room, with an apology for going away; &ldquo;I have gone and done mischief
with my long, stupid tongue.&nbsp; To be sure, people plan a long way
ahead of to-day; more especially when one is a sick man, lying all through
the weary day on a sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady will soon get over her annoyance,&rdquo; said I, as
it were apologetically.&nbsp; I only stopped Miss Galindo&rsquo;s self-reproaches
to draw down her wrath upon myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has not she a right to be annoyed with me, if she likes,
and to keep annoyed as long as she likes?&nbsp; Am I complaining of
her, that you need tell me that?&nbsp; Let me tell you, I have known
my lady these thirty years; and if she were to take me by the shoulders,
and turn me out of the house, I should only love her the more.&nbsp;
So don&rsquo;t you think to come between us with any little mincing,
peace-making speeches.&nbsp; I have been a mischief-making parrot, and
I like her the better for being vexed with me.&nbsp; So good-bye to
you, Miss; and wait till you know Lady Ludlow as well as I do, before
you next think of telling me she will soon get over her annoyance!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And off Miss Galindo went.</p>
<p>I could not exactly tell what I had done wrong; but I took care never
again to come in between my lady and her by any remark about the one
to the other; for I saw that some most powerful bond of grateful affection
made Miss Galindo almost worship my lady.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harry Gregson was limping a little about in the village,
still finding his home in Mr. Gray&rsquo;s house; for there he could
most conveniently be kept under the doctor&rsquo;s eye, and receive
the requisite care, and enjoy the requisite nourishment.&nbsp; As soon
as he was a little better, he was to go to Mr. Horner&rsquo;s house;
but, as the steward lived some distance out of the way, and was much
from home, he had agreed to leave Harry at the house; to which he had
first been taken, until he was quite strong again; and the more willingly,
I suspect, from what I heard afterwards, because Mr. Gray gave up all
the little strength of speaking which he had, to teaching Harry in the
very manner which Mr. Horner most desired.</p>
<p>As for Gregson the father&mdash;he&mdash;wild man of the woods, poacher,
tinker, jack-of-all trades&mdash;was getting tamed by this kindness
to his child.&nbsp; Hitherto his hand had been against every man, as
every man&rsquo;s had been against him.&nbsp; That affair before the
justice, which I told you about, when Mr. Gray and even my lady had
interested themselves to get him released from unjust imprisonment,
was the first bit of justice he had ever met with; it attracted him
to the people, and attached him to the spot on which he had but squatted
for a time.&nbsp; I am not sure if any of the villagers were grateful
to him for remaining in their neighbourhood, instead of decamping as
he had often done before, for good reasons, doubtless, of personal safety.&nbsp;
Harry was only one out of a brood of ten or twelve children, some of
whom had earned for themselves no good character in service: one, indeed,
had been actually transported, for a robbery committed in a distant
part of the county; and the tale was yet told in the village of how
Gregson the father came back from the trial in a state of wild rage,
striding through the place, and uttering oaths of vengeance to himself,
his great black eyes gleaming out of his matted hair, and his arms working
by his side, and now and then tossed up in his impotent despair.&nbsp;
As I heard the account, his wife followed him, child-laden and weeping.&nbsp;
After this, they had vanished from the country for a time, leaving their
mud hovel locked up, and the door-key, as the neighbours said, buried
in a hedge bank.&nbsp; The Gregsons had reappeared much about the same
time that Mr. Gray came to Hanbury.&nbsp; He had either never heard
of their evil character, or considered that it gave them all the more
claims upon his Christian care; and the end of it was, that this rough,
untamed, strong giant of a heathen was loyal slave to the weak, hectic,
nervous, self-distrustful parson.&nbsp; Gregson had also a kind of grumbling
respect for Mr. Horner: he did not quite like the steward&rsquo;s monopoly
of his Harry: the mother submitted to that with a better grace, swallowing
down her maternal jealousy in the prospect of her child&rsquo;s advancement
to a better and more respectable position than that in which his parents
had struggled through life.&nbsp; But Mr. Horner, the steward, and Gregson,
the poacher and squatter, had come into disagreeable contact too often
in former days for them to be perfectly cordial at any future time.&nbsp;
Even now, when there was no immediate cause for anything but gratitude
for his child&rsquo;s sake on Gregson&rsquo;s part, he would skulk out
of Mr. Horner&rsquo;s way, if he saw him coming; and it took all Mr.
Horner&rsquo;s natural reserve and acquired self-restraint to keep him
from occasionally holding up his father&rsquo;s life as a warning to
Harry.&nbsp; Now Gregson had nothing of this desire for avoidance with
regard to Mr. Gray.&nbsp; The poacher had a feeling of physical protection
towards the parson; while the latter had shown the moral courage, without
which Gregson would never have respected him, in coming right down upon
him more than once in the exercise of unlawful pursuits, and simply
and boldly telling him he was doing wrong, with such a quiet reliance
upon Gregson&rsquo;s better feeling, at the same time, that the strong
poacher could not have lifted a finger against Mr. Gray, though it had
been to save himself from being apprehended and taken to the lock-ups
the very next hour.&nbsp; He had rather listened to the parson&rsquo;s
bold words with an approving smile, much as Mr. Gulliver might have
hearkened to a lecture from a Lilliputian.&nbsp; But when brave words
passed into kind deeds, Gregson&rsquo;s heart mutely acknowledged its
master and keeper.&nbsp; And the beauty of it all was, that Mr. Gray
knew nothing of the good work he had done, or recognized himself as
the instrument which God had employed.&nbsp; He thanked God, it is true,
fervently and often, that the work was done; and loved the wild man
for his rough gratitude; but it never occurred to the poor young clergyman,
lying on his sick-bed, and praying, as Miss Galindo had told us he did,
to be forgiven for his unprofitable life, to think of Gregson&rsquo;s
reclaimed soul as anything with which he had had to do.&nbsp; It was
now more than three months since Mr. Gray had been at Hanbury Court.&nbsp;
During all that time he had been confined to his house, if not to his
sick-bed, and he and my lady had never met since their last discussion
and difference about Farmer Hale&rsquo;s barn.</p>
<p>This was not my dear lady&rsquo;s fault; no one could have been more
attentive in every way to the slightest possible want of either of the
invalids, especially of Mr. Gray.&nbsp; And she would have gone to see
him at his own house, as she sent him word, but that her foot had slipped
upon the polished oak staircase, and her ancle had been sprained.</p>
<p>So we had never seen Mr. Gray since his illness, when one November
day he was announced as wishing to speak to my lady.&nbsp; She was sitting
in her room&mdash;the room in which I lay now pretty constantly&mdash;and
I remember she looked startled, when word was brought to her of Mr.
Gray&rsquo;s being at the Hall.</p>
<p>She could not go to him, she was too lame for that, so she bade him
be shown into where she sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a day for him to go out!&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking
at the fog which had crept up to the windows, and was sapping the little
remaining life in the brilliant Virginian creeper leaves that draperied
the house on the terrace side.</p>
<p>He came in white, trembling, his large eyes wild and dilated.&nbsp;
He hastened up to Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s chair, and, to my surprise, took
one of her hands and kissed it, without speaking, yet shaking all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray!&rdquo; said she, quickly, with sharp, tremulous
apprehension of some unknown evil.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; There
is something unusual about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something unusual has occurred,&rdquo; replied he, forcing
his words to be calm, as with a great effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gentleman
came to my house, not half an hour ago&mdash;a Mr. Howard.&nbsp; He
came straight from Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son!&rdquo; said my dear lady, stretching out her arms
in dumb questioning attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord gave and the Lord taketh away.&nbsp; Blessed be the
name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my poor lady could not echo the words.&nbsp; He was the last
remaining child.&nbsp; And once she had been the joyful mother of nine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>I am ashamed to say what feeling became strongest in my mind about
this time; next to the sympathy we all of us felt for my dear lady in
her deep sorrow, I mean; for that was greater and stronger than anything
else, however contradictory you may think it, when you hear all.</p>
<p>It might arise from my being so far from well at the time, which
produced a diseased mind in a diseased body; but I was absolutely jealous
for my father&rsquo;s memory, when I saw how many signs of grief there
were for my lord&rsquo;s death, he having done next to nothing for the
village and parish, which now changed, as it were, its daily course
of life, because his lordship died in a far-off city.&nbsp; My father
had spent the best years of his manhood in labouring hard, body and
soul, for the people amongst whom he lived.&nbsp; His family, of course,
claimed the first place in his heart; he would have been good for little,
even in the way of benevolence, if they had not.&nbsp; But close after
them he cared for his parishioners, and neighbours.&nbsp; And yet, when
he died, though the church-bells tolled, and smote upon our hearts with
hard, fresh pain at every beat, the sounds of every-day life still went
on, close pressing around us,&mdash;carts and carriages, street-cries,
distant barrel-organs (the kindly neighbours kept them out of our street):
life, active, noisy life, pressed on our acute consciousness of Death,
and jarred upon it as on a quick nerve.</p>
<p>And when we went to church,&mdash;my father&rsquo;s own church,&mdash;though
the pulpit cushions were black, and many of the congregation had put
on some humble sign of mourning, yet it did not alter the whole material
aspect of the place.&nbsp; And yet what was Lord Ludlow&rsquo;s relation
to Hanbury, compared to my father&rsquo;s work and place in&mdash;?</p>
<p>O! it was very wicked in me!&nbsp; I think if I had seen my lady,&mdash;if
I had dared to ask to go to her, I should not have felt so miserable,
so discontented.&nbsp; But she sat in her own room, hung with black,
all, even over the shutters.&nbsp; She saw no light but that which was
artificial&mdash;candles, lamps, and the like&mdash;for more than a
month.&nbsp; Only Adams went near her.&nbsp; Mr. Gray was not admitted,
though he called daily.&nbsp; Even Mrs. Medlicott did not see her for
near a fortnight.&nbsp; The sight of my lady&rsquo;s griefs, or rather
the recollection of it, made Mrs. Medlicott talk far more than was her
wont.&nbsp; She told us, with many tears, and much gesticulation, even
speaking German at times, when her English would not flow, that my lady
sat there, a white figure in the middle of the darkened room; a shaded
lamp near her, the light of which fell on an open Bible,&mdash;the great
family Bible.&nbsp; It was not open at any chapter or consoling verse;
but at the page whereon were registered the births of her nine children.&nbsp;
Five had died in infancy,&mdash;sacrificed to the cruel system which
forbade the mother to suckle her babies.&nbsp; Four had lived longer;
Urian had been the first to die, Ughtred-Mortimar, Earl Ludlow, the
last.</p>
<p>My lady did not cry, Mrs. Medlicott said.&nbsp; She was quite composed;
very still, very silent.&nbsp; She put aside everything that savoured
of mere business: sent people to Mr. Horner for that.&nbsp; But she
was proudly alive to every possible form which might do honour to the
last of her race.</p>
<p>In those days, expresses were slow things, and forms still slower.&nbsp;
Before my lady&rsquo;s directions could reach Vienna, my lord was buried.&nbsp;
There was some talk (so Mrs. Medlicott said) about taking the body up,
and bringing him to Hanbury.&nbsp; But his executors,&mdash;connections
on the Ludlow side,&mdash;demurred to this.&nbsp; If he were removed
to England, he must be carried on to Scotland, and interred with his
Monkshaven forefathers.&nbsp; My lady, deeply hurt, withdrew from the
discussion, before it degenerated to an unseemly contest.&nbsp; But
all the more, for this understood mortification of my lady&rsquo;s,
did the whole village and estate of Hanbury assume every outward sign
of mourning.&nbsp; The church bells tolled morning and evening.&nbsp;
The church itself was draped in black inside.&nbsp; Hatchments were
placed everywhere, where hatchments could be put.&nbsp; All the tenantry
spoke in hushed voices for more than a week, scarcely daring to observe
that all flesh, even that of an Earl Ludlow, and the last of the Hanburys,
was but grass after all.&nbsp; The very Fighting Lion closed its front
door, front shutters it had none, and those who needed drink stole in
at the back, and were silent and maudlin over their cups, instead of
riotous and noisy.&nbsp; Miss Galindo&rsquo;s eyes were swollen up with
crying, and she told me, with a fresh burst of tears, that even hump-backed
Sally had been found sobbing over her Bible, and using a pocket-handkerchief
for the first time in her life; her aprons having hitherto stood her
in the necessary stead, but not being sufficiently in accordance with
etiquette to be used when mourning over an earl&rsquo;s premature decease.</p>
<p>If it was this way out of the Hall, &ldquo;you might work it by the
rule of three,&rdquo; as Miss Galindo used to say, and judge what it
was in the Hall.&nbsp; We none of us spoke but in a whisper: we tried
not to eat; and indeed the shock had been so really great, and we did
really care so much for my lady, that for some days we had but little
appetite.&nbsp; But after that, I fear our sympathy grew weaker, while
our flesh grew stronger.&nbsp; But we still spoke low, and our hearts
ached whenever we thought of my lady sitting there alone in the darkened
room, with the light ever falling on that one solemn page.</p>
<p>We wished, O how I wished that she would see Mr. Gray!&nbsp; But
Adams said, she thought my lady ought to have a bishop come to see her.&nbsp;
Still no one had authority enough to send for one.</p>
<p>Mr. Horner all this time was suffering as much as any one.&nbsp;
He was too faithful a servant of the great Hanbury family, though now
the family had dwindled down to a fragile old lady, not to mourn acutely
over its probable extinction.&nbsp; He had, besides, a deeper sympathy
and reverence with, and for, my lady, in all things, than probably he
ever cared to show, for his manners were always measured and cold.&nbsp;
He suffered from sorrow.&nbsp; He also suffered from wrong.&nbsp; My
lord&rsquo;s executors kept writing to him continually.&nbsp; My lady
refused to listen to mere business, saying she intrusted all to him.&nbsp;
But the &ldquo;all&rdquo; was more complicated than I ever thoroughly
understood.&nbsp; As far as I comprehended the case, it was something
of this kind:&mdash;There had been a mortgage raised on my lady&rsquo;s
property of Hanbury, to enable my lord, her husband, to spend money
in cultivating his Scotch estates, after some new fashion that required
capital.&nbsp; As long as my lord, her son, lived, who was to succeed
to both the estates after her death, this did not signify; so she had
said and felt; and she had refused to take any steps to secure the repayment
of capital, or even the payment of the interest of the mortgage from
the possible representatives and possessors of the Scotch estates, to
the possible owner of the Hanbury property; saying it ill became her
to calculate on the contingency of her son&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>But he had died childless, unmarried.&nbsp; The heir of the Monkshaven
property was an Edinburgh advocate, a far-away kinsman of my lord&rsquo;s:
the Hanbury property, at my lady&rsquo;s death, would go to the descendants
of a third son of the Squire Hanbury in the days of Queen Anne.</p>
<p>This complication of affairs was most grievous to Mr. Horner.&nbsp;
He had always been opposed to the mortgage; had hated the payment of
the interest, as obliging my lady to practise certain economies which,
though she took care to make them as personal as possible, he disliked
as derogatory to the family.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Horner!&nbsp; He was so
cold and hard in his manner, so curt and decisive in his speech, that
I don&rsquo;t think we any of us did him justice.&nbsp; Miss Galindo
was almost the first, at this time, to speak a kind word of him, or
to take thought of him at all, any farther than to get out of his way
when we saw him approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Horner is well,&rdquo; she said one
day; about three weeks after we had heard of my lord&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He sits resting his head on his hand, and hardly hears me when
I speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I thought no more of it, as Miss Galindo did not name it again.&nbsp;
My lady came amongst us once more.&nbsp; From elderly she had become
old; a little, frail, old lady, in heavy black drapery, never speaking
about nor alluding to her great sorrow; quieter, gentler, paler than
ever before; and her eyes dim with much weeping, never witnessed by
mortal.</p>
<p>She had seen Mr. Gray at the expiration of the month of deep retirement.&nbsp;
But I do not think that even to him she had said one word of her own
particular individual sorrow.&nbsp; All mention of it seemed buried
deep for evermore.&nbsp; One day, Mr. Horner sent word that he was too
much indisposed to attend to his usual business at the Hall; but he
wrote down some directions and requests to Miss Galindo, saying that
he would be at his office early the next morning.&nbsp; The next morning
he was dead.</p>
<p>Miss Galindo told my lady.&nbsp; Miss Galindo herself cried plentifully,
but my lady, although very much distressed, could not cry.&nbsp; It
seemed a physical impossibility, as if she had shed all the tears in
her power.&nbsp; Moreover, I almost think her wonder was far greater
that she herself lived than that Mr. Horner died.&nbsp; It was almost
natural that so faithful a servant should break his heart, when the
family he belonged to lost their stay, their heir, and their last hope.</p>
<p>Yes!&nbsp; Mr. Horner was a faithful servant.&nbsp; I do not think
there are many so faithful now; but perhaps that is an old woman&rsquo;s
fancy of mine.&nbsp; When his will came to be examined, it was discovered
that, soon after Harry Gregson&rsquo;s accident, Mr. Horner had left
the few thousands (three, I think,) of which he was possessed, in trust
for Harry&rsquo;s benefit, desiring his executors to see that the lad
was well educated in certain things, for which Mr. Horner had thought
that he had shown especial aptitude; and there was a kind of implied
apology to my lady in one sentence where he stated that Harry&rsquo;s
lameness would prevent his being ever able to gain his living by the
exercise of any mere bodily faculties, &ldquo;as had been wished by
a lady whose wishes&rdquo; he, the testator, &ldquo;was bound to regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was a codicil in the will, dated since Lord Ludlow&rsquo;s
death&mdash;feebly written by Mr. Horner himself, as if in preparation
only for some more formal manner of bequest: or, perhaps, only as a
mere temporary arrangement till he could see a lawyer, and have a fresh
will made.&nbsp; In this he revoked his previous bequest to Harry Gregson.&nbsp;
He only left two hundred pounds to Mr Gray to be used, as that gentleman
thought best, for Henry Gregson&rsquo;s benefit.&nbsp; With this one
exception, he bequeathed all the rest of his savings to my lady, with
a hope that they might form a nest-egg, as it were, towards the paying
off of the mortgage which had been such a grief to him during his life.&nbsp;
I may not repeat all this in lawyer&rsquo;s phrase; I heard it through
Miss Galindo, and she might make mistakes.&nbsp; Though, indeed, she
was very clear-headed, and soon earned the respect of Mr. Smithson,
my lady&rsquo;s lawyer from Warwick.&nbsp; Mr. Smithson knew Miss Galindo
a little before, both personally and by reputation; but I don&rsquo;t
think he was prepared to find her installed as steward&rsquo;s clerk,
and, at first, he was inclined to treat her, in this capacity, with
polite contempt.&nbsp; But Miss Galindo was both a lady and a spirited,
sensible woman, and she could put aside her self-indulgence in eccentricity
of speech and manner whenever she chose.&nbsp; Nay more; she was usually
so talkative, that if she had not been amusing and warm-hearted, one
might have thought her wearisome occasionally.&nbsp; But to meet Mr.
Smithson she came out daily in her Sunday gown; she said no more than
was required in answer to his questions; her books and papers were in
thorough order, and methodically kept; her statements of matters-of-fact
accurate, and to be relied on.&nbsp; She was amusingly conscious of
her victory over his contempt of a woman-clerk and his preconceived
opinion of her unpractical eccentricity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me alone,&rdquo; said she, one day when she came in to
sit awhile with me.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man is a good man&mdash;a sensible
man&mdash;and I have no doubt he is a good lawyer; but he can&rsquo;t
fathom women yet.&nbsp; I make no doubt he&rsquo;ll go back to Warwick,
and never give credit again to those people who made him think me half-cracked
to begin with.&nbsp; O, my dear, he did!&nbsp; He showed it twenty times
worse than my poor dear master ever did.&nbsp; It was a form to be gone
through to please my lady, and, for her sake, he would hear my statements
and see my books.&nbsp; It was keeping a woman out of harm&rsquo;s way,
at any rate, to let her fancy herself useful.&nbsp; I read the man.&nbsp;
And, I am thankful to say, he cannot read me.&nbsp; At least, only one
side of me.&nbsp; When I see an end to be gained, I can behave myself
accordingly.&nbsp; Here was a man who thought that a woman in a black
silk gown was a respectable, orderly kind of person; and I was a woman
in a black silk gown.&nbsp; He believed that a woman could not write
straight lines, and required a man to tell her that two and two made
four.&nbsp; I was not above ruling my books, and had Cocker a little
more at my fingers&rsquo; ends than he had.&nbsp; But my greatest triumph
has been holding my tongue.&nbsp; He would have thought nothing of my
books, or my sums, or my black silk gown, if I had spoken unasked.&nbsp;
So I have buried more sense in my bosom these ten days than ever I have
uttered in the whole course of my life before.&nbsp; I have been so
curt, so abrupt, so abominably dull, that I&rsquo;ll answer for it he
thinks me worthy to be a man.&nbsp; But I must go back to him, my dear,
so good-bye to conversation and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though Mr. Smithson might be satisfied with Miss Galindo, I am
afraid she was the only part of the affair with which he was content.&nbsp;
Everything else went wrong.&nbsp; I could not say who told me so&mdash;but
the conviction of this seemed to pervade the house.&nbsp; I never knew
how much we had all looked up to the silent, gruff Mr. Horner for decisions,
until he was gone.&nbsp; My lady herself was a pretty good woman of
business, as women of business go.&nbsp; Her father, seeing that she
would be the heiress of the Hanbury property, had given her a training
which was thought unusual in those days, and she liked to feel herself
queen regnant, and to have to decide in all cases between herself and
her tenantry.&nbsp; But, perhaps, Mr. Horner would have done it more
wisely; not but what she always attended to him at last.&nbsp; She would
begin by saying, pretty clearly and promptly, what she would have done,
and what she would not have done.&nbsp; If Mr. Horner approved of it,
he bowed, and set about obeying her directly; if he disapproved of it,
he bowed, and lingered so long before he obeyed her, that she forced
his opinion out of him with her &ldquo;Well, Mr. Horner! and what have
you to say against it?&rdquo;&nbsp; For she always understood his silence
as well as if he had spoken.&nbsp; But the estate was pressed for ready
money, and Mr. Horner had grown gloomy and languid since the death of
his wife, and even his own personal affairs were not in the order in
which they had been a year or two before, for his old clerk had gradually
become superannuated, or, at any rate, unable by the superfluity of
his own energy and wit to supply the spirit that was wanting in Mr.
Horner.</p>
<p>Day after day Mr. Smithson seemed to grow more fidgety, more annoyed
at the state of affairs.&nbsp; Like every one else employed by Lady
Ludlow, as far as I could learn, he had an hereditary tie to the Hanbury
family.&nbsp; As long as the Smithsons had been lawyers, they had been
lawyers to the Hanburys; always coming in on all great family occasions,
and better able to understand the characters, and connect the links
of what had once been a large and scattered family, than any individual
thereof had ever been.</p>
<p>As long as a man was at the head of the Hanburys, the lawyers had
simply acted as servants, and had only given their advice when it was
required.&nbsp; But they had assumed a different position on the memorable
occasion of the mortgage: they had remonstrated against it.&nbsp; My
lady had resented this remonstrance, and a slight, unspoken coolness
had existed between her and the father of this Mr. Smithson ever since.</p>
<p>I was very sorry for my lady.&nbsp; Mr. Smithson was inclined to
blame Mr. Horner for the disorderly state in which he found some of
the outlying farms, and for the deficiencies in the annual payment of
rents.&nbsp; Mr. Smithson had too much good feeling to put this blame
into words; but my lady&rsquo;s quick instinct led her to reply to a
thought, the existence of which she perceived; and she quietly told
the truth, and explained how she had interfered repeatedly to prevent
Mr. Horner from taking certain desirable steps, which were discordant
to her hereditary sense of right and wrong between landlord and tenant.&nbsp;
She also spoke of the want of ready money as a misfortune that could
be remedied, by more economical personal expenditure on her own part;
by which individual saving, it was possible that a reduction of fifty
pounds a year might have been accomplished.&nbsp; But as soon as Mr.
Smithson touched on larger economies, such as either affected the welfare
of others, or the honour and standing of the great House of Hanbury,
she was inflexible.&nbsp; Her establishment consisted of somewhere about
forty servants, of whom nearly as many as twenty were unable to perform
their work properly, and yet would have been hurt if they had been dismissed;
so they had the credit of fulfilling duties, while my lady paid and
kept their substitutes.&nbsp; Mr. Smithson made a calculation, and would
have saved some hundreds a year by pensioning off these old servants.&nbsp;
But my lady would not hear of it.&nbsp; Then, again, I know privately
that he urged her to allow some of us to return to our homes.&nbsp;
Bitterly we should have regretted the separation from Lady Ludlow; but
we would have gone back gladly, had we known at the time that her circumstances
required it: but she would not listen to the proposal for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I cannot act justly towards every one, I will give up a
plan which has been a source of much satisfaction; at least, I will
not carry it out to such an extent in future.&nbsp; But to these young
ladies, who do me the favour to live with me at present, I stand pledged.&nbsp;
I cannot go back from my word, Mr. Smithson.&nbsp; We had better talk
no more of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she entered the room where I lay.&nbsp; She and Mr.
Smithson were coming for some papers contained in the bureau.&nbsp;
They did not know I was there, and Mr. Smithson started a little when
he saw me, as he must have been aware that I had overheard something.&nbsp;
But my lady did not change a muscle of her face.&nbsp; All the world
might overhear her kind, just, pure sayings, and she had no fear of
their misconstruction.&nbsp; She came up to me, and kissed me on the
forehead, and then went to search for the required papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rode over the Connington farms yesterday, my lady.&nbsp;
I must say I was quite grieved to see the condition they are in; all
the land that is not waste is utterly exhausted with working successive
white crops.&nbsp; Not a pinch of manure laid on the ground for years.&nbsp;
I must say that a greater contrast could never have been presented than
that between Harding&rsquo;s farm and the next fields&mdash;fences in
perfect order, rotation crops, sheep eating down the turnips on the
waste lands&mdash;everything that could be desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose farm is that?&rdquo; asked my lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I am sorry to say, it was on none of your ladyship&rsquo;s
that I saw such good methods adopted.&nbsp; I hoped it was, I stopped
my horse to inquire.&nbsp; A queer-looking man, sitting on his horse
like a tailor, watching his men with a couple of the sharpest eyes I
ever saw, and dropping his h&rsquo;s at every word, answered my question,
and told me it was his.&nbsp; I could not go on asking him who he was;
but I fell into conversation with him, and I gathered that he had earned
some money in trade in Birmingham, and had bought the estate (five hundred
acres, I think he said,) on which he was born, and now was setting himself
to cultivate it in downright earnest, going to Holkham and Woburn, and
half the country over, to get himself up on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be Brooke, that dissenting baker from Birmingham,&rdquo;
said my lady in her most icy tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Smithson, I am sorry
I have been detaining you so long, but I think these are the letters
you wished to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If her ladyship thought by this speech to quench Mr. Smithson she
was mistaken.&nbsp; Mr. Smithson just looked at the letters, and went
on with the old subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lady, it struck me that if you had such a man to take
poor Horner&rsquo;s place, he would work the rents and the land round
most satisfactorily.&nbsp; I should not despair of inducing this very
man to undertake the work.&nbsp; I should not mind speaking to him myself
on the subject, for we got capital friends over a snack of luncheon
that he asked me to share with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow fixed her eyes on Mr. Smithson as he spoke, and never
took them off his face until he had ended.&nbsp; She was silent a minute
before she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, Mr. Smithson, but I need not trouble you
with any such arrangements.&nbsp; I am going to write this afternoon
to Captain James, a friend of one of my sons, who has, I hear, been
severely wounded at Trafalgar, to request him to honour me by accepting
Mr. Horner&rsquo;s situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Captain James!&nbsp; A captain in the navy! going to manage
your ladyship&rsquo;s estate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he will be so kind.&nbsp; I shall esteem it a condescension
on his part; but I hear that he will have to resign his profession,
his state of health is so bad, and a country life is especially prescribed
for him.&nbsp; I am in some hopes of tempting him here, as I learn he
has but little to depend on if he gives up his profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Captain James! an invalid captain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I am asking too great a favour,&rdquo; continued
my lady.&nbsp; (I never could tell how far it was simplicity, or how
far a kind of innocent malice, that made her misinterpret Mr. Smithson&rsquo;s
words and looks as she did.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But he is not a post-captain,
only a commander, and his pension will be but small.&nbsp; I may be
able, by offering him country air and a healthy occupation, to restore
him to health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occupation!&nbsp; My lady, may I ask how a sailor is to manage
land?&nbsp; Why, your tenants will laugh him to scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tenants, I trust, will not behave so ill as to laugh at
any one I choose to set over them.&nbsp; Captain James has had experience
in managing men.&nbsp; He has remarkable practical talents, and great
common sense, as I hear from every one.&nbsp; But, whatever he may be,
the affair rests between him and myself.&nbsp; I can only say I shall
esteem myself fortunate if he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no more to be said, after my lady spoke in this manner.&nbsp;
I had heard her mention Captain James before, as a middy who had been
very kind to her son Urian.&nbsp; I thought I remembered then, that
she had mentioned that his family circumstances were not very prosperous.&nbsp;
But, I confess, that little as I knew of the management of land, I quite
sided with Mr. Smithson.&nbsp; He, silently prohibited from again speaking
to my lady on the subject, opened his mind to Miss Galindo, from whom
I was pretty sure to hear all the opinions and news of the household
and village.&nbsp; She had taken a great fancy to me, because she said
I talked so agreeably.&nbsp; I believe it was because I listened so
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have you heard the news,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;about
this Captain James?&nbsp; A sailor,&mdash;with a wooden leg, I have
no doubt.&nbsp; What would the poor, dear, deceased master have said
to it, if he had known who was to be his successor!&nbsp; My dear, I
have often thought of the postman&rsquo;s bringing me a letter as one
of the pleasures I shall miss in heaven.&nbsp; But, really, I think
Mr. Horner may be thankful he has got out of the reach of news; or else
he would hear of Mr. Smithson&rsquo;s having made up to the Birmingham
baker, and of his one-legged captain, coming to dot-and-go-one over
the estate.&nbsp; I suppose he will look after the labourers through
a spy-glass.&nbsp; I only hope he won&rsquo;t stick in the mud with
his wooden leg; for I, for one, won&rsquo;t help him out.&nbsp; Yes,
I would,&rdquo; said she, correcting herself; &ldquo;I would, for my
lady&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you sure he has a wooden leg?&rdquo; asked I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I heard Lady Ludlow tell Mr. Smithson about him, and she only
spoke of him as wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sailors are almost always wounded in the leg.&nbsp;
Look at Greenwich Hospital!&nbsp; I should say there were twenty one-legged
pensioners to one without an arm there.&nbsp; But say he has got half-a-dozen
legs: what has he to do with managing land?&nbsp; I shall think him
very impudent if he comes, taking advantage of my lady&rsquo;s kind
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, come he did.&nbsp; In a month from that time, the carriage
was sent to meet Captain James; just as three years before it had been
sent to meet me.&nbsp; His coming had been so much talked about that
we were all as curious as possible to see him, and to know how so unusual
an experiment, as it seemed to us, would answer.&nbsp; But, before I
tell you anything about our new agent, I must speak of something quite
as interesting, and I really think quite as important.&nbsp; And this
was my lady&rsquo;s making friends with Harry Gregson.&nbsp; I do believe
she did it for Mr. Horner&rsquo;s sake; but, of course, I can only conjecture
why my lady did anything.&nbsp; But I heard one day, from Mary Legard,
that my lady had sent for Harry to come and see her, if he was well
enough to walk so far; and the next day he was shown into the room he
had been in once before under such unlucky circumstances.</p>
<p>The lad looked pale enough, as he stood propping himself up on his
crutch, and the instant my lady saw him, she bade John Footman place
a stool for him to sit down upon while she spoke to him.&nbsp; It might
be his paleness that gave his whole face a more refined and gentle look;
but I suspect it was that the boy was apt to take impressions, and that
Mr. Horner&rsquo;s grave, dignified ways, and Mr. Gray&rsquo;s tender
and quiet manners, had altered him; and then the thoughts of illness
and death seem to turn many of us into gentlemen, and gentlewomen, as
long as such thoughts are in our minds.&nbsp; We cannot speak loudly
or angrily at such times; we are not apt to be eager about mere worldly
things, for our very awe at our quickened sense of the nearness of the
invisible world, makes us calm and serene about the petty trifles of
to-day.&nbsp; At least, I know that was the explanation Mr. Gray once
gave me of what we all thought the great improvement in Harry Gregson&rsquo;s
way of behaving.</p>
<p>My lady hesitated so long about what she had best say, that Harry
grew a little frightened at her silence.&nbsp; A few months ago it would
have surprised me more than it did now; but since my lord her son&rsquo;s
death, she had seemed altered in many ways,&mdash;more uncertain and
distrustful of herself, as it were.</p>
<p>At last she said, and I think the tears were in her eyes: &ldquo;My
poor little fellow, you have had a narrow escape with your life since
I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this there was nothing to be said but &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and again
there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have lost a good, kind friend, in Mr. Horner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s lips worked, and I think he said, &ldquo;Please,
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t be sure; at any rate, my
lady went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have I,&mdash;a good, kind friend, he was to both of
us; and to you he wished to show his kindness in even a more generous
way than he has done.&nbsp; Mr. Gray has told you about his legacy to
you, has he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no sign of eager joy on the lad&rsquo;s face, as if he
realised the power and pleasure of having what to him must have seemed
like a fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gray said as how he had left me a matter of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has left you two hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would rather have had him alive, my lady,&rdquo; he
burst out, sobbing as if his heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lad, I believe you.&nbsp; We would rather have had our
dead alive, would we not? and there is nothing in money that can comfort
us for their loss.&nbsp; But you know&mdash;Mr. Gray has told you&mdash;who
has appointed all our times to die.&nbsp; Mr. Horner was a good, just
man; and has done well and kindly, both by me and you.&nbsp; You perhaps
do not know&rdquo; (and now I understood what my lady had been making
up her mind to say to Harry, all the time she was hesitating how to
begin) &ldquo;that Mr. Horner, at one time, meant to leave you a great
deal more; probably all he had, with the exception of a legacy to his
old clerk, Morrison.&nbsp; But he knew that this estate&mdash;on which
my forefathers had lived for six hundred years&mdash;was in debt, and
that I had no immediate chance of paying off this debt; and yet he felt
that it was a very sad thing for an old property like this to belong
in part to those other men, who had lent the money.&nbsp; You understand
me, I think, my little man?&rdquo; said she, questioning Harry&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>He had left off crying, and was trying to understand, with all his
might and main; and I think he had got a pretty good general idea of
the state of affairs; though probably he was puzzled by the term &ldquo;the
estate being in debt.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was sufficiently interested
to want my lady to go on; and he nodded his head at her, to signify
this to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Horner took the money which he once meant to be yours,
and has left the greater part of it to me, with the intention of helping
me to pay off this debt I have told you about.&nbsp; It will go a long
way, and I shall try hard to save the rest, and then I shall die happy
in leaving the land free from debt.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I shall not die happy in thinking of you.&nbsp; I do not know if having
money, or even having a great estate and much honour, is a good thing
for any of us.&nbsp; But God sees fit that some of us should be called
to this condition, and it is our duty then to stand by our posts, like
brave soldiers.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Horner intended you to have this money
first.&nbsp; I shall only call it borrowing from you, Harry Gregson,
if I take it and use it to pay off the debt.&nbsp; I shall pay Mr. Gray
interest on this money, because he is to stand as your guardian, as
it were, till you come of age; and he must fix what ought to be done
with it, so as to fit you for spending the principal rightly when the
estate can repay it you.&nbsp; I suppose, now, it will be right for
you to be educated.&nbsp; That will be another snare that will come
with your money.&nbsp; But have courage, Harry.&nbsp; Both education
and money may be used rightly, if we only pray against the temptations
they bring with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry could make no answer, though I am sure he understood it all.&nbsp;
My lady wanted to get him to talk to her a little, by way of becoming
acquainted with what was passing in his mind; and she asked him what
he would like to have done with his money, if he could have part of
it now?&nbsp; To such a simple question, involving no talk about feelings,
his answer came readily enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Build a cottage for father, with stairs in it, and give Mr.
Gray a school-house.&nbsp; O, father does so want Mr. Gray for to have
his wish!&nbsp; Father saw all the stones lying quarried and hewn on
Farmer Hale&rsquo;s land; Mr. Gray had paid for them all himself.&nbsp;
And father said he would work night and day, and little Tommy should
carry mortar, if the parson would let him, sooner than that he should
be fretted and frabbed as he was, with no one giving him a helping hand
or a kind word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry knew nothing of my lady&rsquo;s part in the affair; that was
very clear.&nbsp; My lady kept silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I might have a piece of my money, I would buy land from
Mr. Brooks; he has got a bit to sell just at the corner of Hendon Lane,
and I would give it to Mr. Gray; and, perhaps, if your ladyship thinks
I may be learned again, I might grow up into the schoolmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good boy,&rdquo; said my lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
there are more things to be thought of, in carrying out such a plan,
than you are aware of.&nbsp; However, it shall be tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The school, my lady?&rdquo; I exclaimed, almost thinking she
did not know what she was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the school.&nbsp; For Mr. Horner&rsquo;s sake, for Mr.
Gray&rsquo;s sake, and last, not least, for this lad&rsquo;s sake, I
will give the new plan a trial.&nbsp; Ask Mr. Gray to come up to me
this afternoon about the land he wants.&nbsp; He need not go to a Dissenter
for it.&nbsp; And tell your father he shall have a good share in the
building of it, and Tommy shall carry the mortar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I may be schoolmaster?&rdquo; asked Harry, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said my lady, amused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be some time before that plan comes to pass, my little
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now to return to Captain James.&nbsp; My first account of him
was from Miss Galindo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not above thirty; and I must just pack up my pens
and my paper, and be off; for it would be the height of impropriety
for me to be staying here as his clerk.&nbsp; It was all very well in
the old master&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; But here am I, not fifty till next
May, and this young, unmarried man, who is not even a widower!&nbsp;
O, there would be no end of gossip.&nbsp; Besides he looks as askance
at me as I do at him.&nbsp; My black silk gown had no effect.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s afraid I shall marry him.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t; he may
feel himself quite safe from that.&nbsp; And Mr. Smithson has been recommending
a clerk to my lady.&nbsp; She would far rather keep me on; but I can&rsquo;t
stop.&nbsp; I really could not think it proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a looking man is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, nothing particular.&nbsp; Short, and brown, and sunburnt.&nbsp;
I did not think it became me to look at him.&nbsp; Well, now for the
nightcaps.&nbsp; I should have grudged any one else doing them, for
I have got such a pretty pattern!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when it came to Miss Galindo&rsquo;s leaving, there was a great
misunderstanding between her and my lady.&nbsp; Miss Galindo had imagined
that my lady had asked her as a favour to copy the letters, and enter
the accounts, and had agreed to do the work without the notion of being
paid for so doing.&nbsp; She had, now and then, grieved over a very
profitable order for needlework passing out of her hands on account
of her not having time to do it, because of her occupation at the Hall;
but she had never hinted this to my lady, but gone on cheerfully at
her writing as long as her clerkship was required.&nbsp; My lady was
annoyed that she had not made her intention of paying Miss Galindo more
clear, in the first conversation she had had with her; but I suppose
that she had been too delicate to be very explicit with regard to money
matters; and now Miss Galindo was quite hurt at my lady&rsquo;s wanting
to pay her for what she had done in such right-down good-will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miss Galindo said; &ldquo;my own dear lady, you
may be as angry with me as you like, but don&rsquo;t offer me money.&nbsp;
Think of six-and-twenty years ago, and poor Arthur, and as you were
to me then!&nbsp; Besides, I wanted money&mdash;I don&rsquo;t disguise
it&mdash;for a particular purpose; and when I found that (God bless
you for asking me!) I could do you a service, I turned it over in my
mind, and I gave up one plan and took up another, and it&rsquo;s all
settled now.&nbsp; Bessy is to leave school and come and live with me.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t, please, offer me money again.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
how glad I have been to do anything for you.&nbsp; Have not I, Margaret
Dawson?&nbsp; Did you not hear me say, one day, I would cut off my hand
for my lady; for am I a stick or a stone, that I should forget kindness?&nbsp;
O, I have been so glad to work for you.&nbsp; And now Bessy is coming
here; and no one knows anything about her&mdash;as if she had done anything
wrong, poor child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Galindo,&rdquo; replied my lady, &ldquo;I will never
ask you to take money again.&nbsp; Only I thought it was quite understood
between us.&nbsp; And you know you have taken money for a set of morning
wrappers, before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady; but that was not confidential.&nbsp; Now I was
so proud to have something to do for you confidentially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is Bessy?&rdquo; asked my lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do
not understand who she is, or why she is to come and live with you.&nbsp;
Dear Miss Galindo, you must honour me by being confidential with me
in your turn!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>I had always understood that Miss Galindo had once been in much better
circumstances, but I had never liked to ask any questions respecting
her.&nbsp; But about this time many things came out respecting her former
life, which I will try and arrange: not however, in the order in which
I heard them, but rather as they occurred.</p>
<p>Miss Galindo was the daughter of a clergyman in Westmoreland.&nbsp;
Her father was the younger brother of a baronet, his ancestor having
been one of those of James the First&rsquo;s creation.&nbsp; This baronet-uncle
of Miss Galindo was one of the queer, out-of-the-way people who were
bred at that time, and in that northern district of England.&nbsp; I
never heard much of him from any one, besides this one great fact: that
he had early disappeared from his family, which indeed only consisted
of a brother and sister who died unmarried, and lived no one knew where,&mdash;somewhere
on the Continent, it was supposed, for he had never returned from the
grand tour which he had been sent to make, according to the general
fashion of the day, as soon as he had left Oxford.&nbsp; He corresponded
occasionally with his brother the clergyman; but the letters passed
through a banker&rsquo;s hands; the banker being pledged to secrecy,
and, as he told Mr. Galindo, having the penalty, if he broke his pledge,
of losing the whole profitable business, and of having the management
of the baronet&rsquo;s affairs taken out of his hands, without any advantage
accruing to the inquirer, for Sir Lawrence had told Messrs. Graham that,
in case his place of residence was revealed by them, not only would
he cease to bank with them, but instantly take measures to baffle any
future inquiries as to his whereabouts, by removing to some distant
country.</p>
<p>Sir Lawrence paid a certain sum of money to his brother&rsquo;s account
every year; but the time of this payment varied, and it was sometimes
eighteen or nineteen months between the deposits; then, again, it would
not be above a quarter of the time, showing that he intended it to be
annual, but, as this intention was never expressed in words, it was
impossible to rely upon it, and a great deal of this money was swallowed
up by the necessity Mr. Galindo felt himself under of living in the
large, old, rambling family mansion, which had been one of Sir Lawrence&rsquo;s
rarely expressed desires.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Galindo often planned to
live upon their own small fortune and the income derived from the living
(a vicarage, of which the great tithes went to Sir Lawrence as lay impropriator),
so as to put-by the payments made by the baronet, for the benefit of
Laurentia&mdash;our Miss Galindo.&nbsp; But I suppose they found it
difficult to live economically in a large house, even though they had
it rent free.&nbsp; They had to keep up with hereditary neighbours and
friends, and could hardly help doing it in the hereditary manner.</p>
<p>One of these neighbours, a Mr. Gibson, had a son a few years older
than Laurentia.&nbsp; The families were sufficiently intimate for the
young people to see a good deal of each other: and I was told that this
young Mr. Mark Gibson was an unusually prepossessing man (he seemed
to have impressed every one who spoke of him to me as being a handsome,
manly, kind-hearted fellow), just what a girl would be sure to find
most agreeable.&nbsp; The parents either forgot that their children
were growing up to man&rsquo;s and woman&rsquo;s estate, or thought
that the intimacy and probable attachment would be no bad thing, even
if it did lead to a marriage.&nbsp; Still, nothing was ever said by
young Gibson till later on, when it was too late, as it turned out.&nbsp;
He went to and from Oxford; he shot and fished with Mr. Galindo, or
came to the Mere to skate in winter-time; was asked to accompany Mr.
Galindo to the Hall, as the latter returned to the quiet dinner with
his wife and daughter; and so, and so, it went on, nobody much knew
how, until one day, when Mr. Galindo received a formal letter from his
brother&rsquo;s bankers, announcing Sir Lawrence&rsquo;s death, of malaria
fever, at Albano, and congratulating Sir Hubert on his accession to
the estates and the baronetcy.&nbsp; The king is dead&mdash;&ldquo;Long
live the king!&rdquo; as I have since heard that the French express
it.</p>
<p>Sir Hubert and his wife were greatly surprised.&nbsp; Sir Lawrence
was but two years older than his brother; and they had never heard of
any illness till they heard of his death.&nbsp; They were sorry; very
much shocked; but still a little elated at the succession to the baronetcy
and estates.&nbsp; The London bankers had managed everything well.&nbsp;
There was a large sum of ready money in their hands, at Sir Hubert&rsquo;s
service, until he should touch his rents, the rent-roll being eight
thousand a-year.&nbsp; And only Laurentia to inherit it all!&nbsp; Her
mother, a poor clergyman&rsquo;s daughter, began to plan all sorts of
fine marriages for her; nor was her father much behind his wife in his
ambition.&nbsp; They took her up to London, when they went to buy new
carriages, and dresses, and furniture.&nbsp; And it was then and there
she made my lady&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp; How it was that they came
to take a fancy to each other, I cannot say.&nbsp; My lady was of the
old nobility,&mdash;grand, compose, gentle, and stately in her ways.&nbsp;
Miss Galindo must always have been hurried in her manner, and her energy
must have shown itself in inquisitiveness and oddness even in her youth.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t pretend to account for things: I only narrate them.&nbsp;
And the fact was this:&mdash;that the elegant, fastidious countess was
attracted to the country girl, who on her part almost worshipped my
lady.&nbsp; My lady&rsquo;s notice of their daughter made her parents
think, I suppose, that there was no match that she might not command;
she, the heiress of eight thousand a-year, and visiting about among
earls and dukes.&nbsp; So when they came back to their old Westmoreland
Hall, and Mark Gibson rode over to offer his hand and his heart, and
prospective estate of nine hundred a-year, to his old companion and
playfellow, Laurentia, Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo made very short work
of it.&nbsp; They refused him plumply themselves; and when he begged
to be allowed to speak to Laurentia, they found some excuse for refusing
him the opportunity of so doing, until they had talked to her themselves,
and brought up every argument and fact in their power to convince her&mdash;a
plain girl, and conscious of her plainness&mdash;that Mr. Mark Gibson
had never thought of her in the way of marriage till after her father&rsquo;s
accession to his fortune; and that it was the estate&mdash;not the young
lady&mdash;that he was in love with.&nbsp; I suppose it will never be
known in this world how far this supposition of theirs was true.&nbsp;
My Lady Ludlow had always spoken as if it was; but perhaps events, which
came to her knowledge about this time, altered her opinion.&nbsp; At
any rate, the end of it was, Laurentia refused Mark, and almost broke
her heart in doing so.&nbsp; He discovered the suspicions of Sir Hubert
and Lady Galindo, and that they had persuaded their daughter to share
in them.&nbsp; So he flung off with high words, saying that they did
not know a true heart when they met with one; and that although he had
never offered till after Sir Lawrence&rsquo;s death, yet that his father
knew all along that he had been attached to Laurentia, only that he,
being the eldest of five children, and having as yet no profession,
had had to conceal, rather than to express, an attachment, which, in
those days, he had believed was reciprocated.&nbsp; He had always meant
to study for the bar, and the end of all he had hoped for had been to
earn a moderate income, which he might ask Laurentia to share.&nbsp;
This, or something like it, was what he said.&nbsp; But his reference
to his father cut two ways.&nbsp; Old Mr. Gibson was known to be very
keen about money.&nbsp; It was just as likely that he would urge Mark
to make love to the heiress, now she was an heiress, as that he would
have restrained him previously, as Mark said he had done.&nbsp; When
this was repeated to Mark, he became proudly reserved, or sullen, and
said that Laurentia, at any rate, might have known him better.&nbsp;
He left the country, and went up to London to study law soon afterwards;
and Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo thought they were well rid of him.&nbsp;
But Laurentia never ceased reproaching herself, and never did to her
dying day, as I believe.&nbsp; The words, &ldquo;She might have known
me better,&rdquo; told to her by some kind friend or other, rankled
in her mind, and were never forgotten.&nbsp; Her father and mother took
her up to London the next year; but she did not care to visit&mdash;dreaded
going out even for a drive, lest she should see Mark Gibson&rsquo;s
reproachful eyes&mdash;pined and lost her health.&nbsp; Lady Ludlow
saw this change with regret, and was told the cause by Lady Galindo,
who of course, gave her own version of Mark&rsquo;s conduct and motives.&nbsp;
My lady never spoke to Miss Galindo about it, but tried constantly to
interest and please her.&nbsp; It was at this time that my lady told
Miss Galindo so much about her own early life, and about Hanbury, that
Miss Galindo resolved, if ever she could, she would go and see the old
place which her friend loved so well.&nbsp; The end of it all was, that
she came to live there, as we know.</p>
<p>But a great change was to come first.&nbsp; Before Sir Hubert and
Lady Galindo had left London on this, their second visit, they had a
letter from the lawyer, whom they employed, saying that Sir Lawrence
had left an heir, his legitimate child by an Italian woman of low rank;
at least, legal claims to the title and property had been sent into
him on the boy&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; Sir Lawrence had always been a
man of adventurous and artistic, rather than of luxurious tastes; and
it was supposed, when all came to be proved at the trial, that he was
captivated by the free, beautiful life they lead in Italy, and had married
this Neapolitan fisherman&rsquo;s daughter, who had people about her
shrewd enough to see that the ceremony was legally performed.&nbsp;
She and her husband had wandered about the shores of the Mediterranean
for years, leading a happy, careless, irresponsible life, unencumbered
by any duties except those connected with a rather numerous family.&nbsp;
It was enough for her that they never wanted money, and that her husband&rsquo;s
love was always continued to her.&nbsp; She hated the name of England&mdash;wicked,
cold, heretic England&mdash;and avoided the mention of any subjects
connected with her husband&rsquo;s early life.&nbsp; So that, when he
died at Albano, she was almost roused out of her vehement grief to anger
with the Italian doctor, who declared that he must write to a certain
address to announce the death of Lawrence Galindo.&nbsp; For some time,
she feared lest English barbarians might come down upon her, making
a claim to the children.&nbsp; She hid herself and them in the Abruzzi,
living upon the sale of what furniture and jewels Sir Lawrence had died
possessed of.&nbsp; When these failed, she returned to Naples, which
she had not visited since her marriage.&nbsp; Her father was dead; but
her brother inherited some of his keenness.&nbsp; He interested the
priests, who made inquiries and found that the Galindo succession was
worth securing to an heir of the true faith.&nbsp; They stirred about
it, obtained advice at the English Embassy; and hence that letter to
the lawyers, calling upon Sir Hubert to relinquish title and property,
and to refund what money he had expended.&nbsp; He was vehement in his
opposition to this claim.&nbsp; He could not bear to think of his brother
having married a foreigner&mdash;a papist, a fisherman&rsquo;s daughter;
nay, of his having become a papist himself.&nbsp; He was in despair
at the thought of his ancestral property going to the issue of such
a marriage.&nbsp; He fought tooth and nail, making enemies of his relations,
and losing almost all his own private property; for he would go on against
the lawyer&rsquo;s advice, long after every one was convinced except
himself and his wife.&nbsp; At last he was conquered.&nbsp; He gave
up his living in gloomy despair.&nbsp; He would have changed his name
if he could, so desirous was he to obliterate all tie between himself
and the mongrel papist baronet and his Italian mother, and all the succession
of children and nurses who came to take possession of the Hall soon
after Mr. Hubert Galindo&rsquo;s departure, stayed there one winter,
and then flitted back to Naples with gladness and delight.&nbsp; Mr.
and Mrs. Hubert Galindo lived in London.&nbsp; He had obtained a curacy
somewhere in the city.&nbsp; They would have been thankful now if Mr.
Mark Gibson had renewed his offer.&nbsp; No one could accuse him of
mercenary motives if he had done so.&nbsp; Because he did not come forward,
as they wished, they brought his silence up as a justification of what
they had previously attributed to him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
Miss Galindo thought herself; but Lady Ludlow has told me how she shrank
from hearing her parents abuse him.&nbsp; Lady Ludlow supposed that
he was aware that they were living in London.&nbsp; His father must
have known the fact, and it was curious if he had never named it to
his son.&nbsp; Besides, the name was very uncommon; and it was unlikely
that it should never come across him, in the advertisements of charity
sermons which the new and rather eloquent curate of Saint Mark&rsquo;s
East was asked to preach.&nbsp; All this time Lady Ludlow never lost
sight of them, for Miss Galindo&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; And when the father
and mother died, it was my lady who upheld Miss Galindo in her determination
not to apply for any provision to her cousin, the Italian baronet, but
rather to live upon the hundred a-year which had been settled on her
mother and the children of his son Hubert&rsquo;s marriage by the old
grandfather, Sir Lawrence.</p>
<p>Mr. Mark Gibson had risen to some eminence as a barrister on the
Northern Circuit, but had died unmarried in the lifetime of his father,
a victim (so people said) to intemperance.&nbsp; Doctor Trevor, the
physician who had been called in to Mr. Gray and Harry Gregson, had
married a sister of his.&nbsp; And that was all my lady knew about the
Gibson family.&nbsp; But who was Bessy?</p>
<p>That mystery and secret came out, too, in process of time.&nbsp;
Miss Galindo had been to Warwick, some years before I arrived at Hanbury,
on some kind of business or shopping, which can only be transacted in
a county town.&nbsp; There was an old Westmoreland connection between
her and Mrs. Trevor, though I believe the latter was too young to have
been made aware of her brother&rsquo;s offer to Miss Galindo at the
time when it took place; and such affairs, if they are unsuccessful,
are seldom spoken about in the gentleman&rsquo;s family afterwards.&nbsp;
But the Gibsons and Galindos had been county neighbours too long for
the connection not to be kept up between two members settled far away
from their early homes.&nbsp; Miss Galindo always desired her parcels
to be sent to Dr. Trevor&rsquo;s, when she went to Warwick for shopping
purchases.&nbsp; If she were going any journey, and the coach did not
come through Warwick as soon as she arrived (in my lady&rsquo;s coach
or otherwise) from Hanbury, she went to Doctor Trevor&rsquo;s to wait.&nbsp;
She was as much expected to sit down to the household meals as if she
had been one of the family: and in after-years it was Mrs. Trevor who
managed her repository business for her.</p>
<p>So, on the day I spoke of, she had gone to Doctor Trevor&rsquo;s
to rest, and possibly to dine.&nbsp; The post in those times, came in
at all hours of the morning: and Doctor Trevor&rsquo;s letters had not
arrived until after his departure on his morning round.&nbsp; Miss Galindo
was sitting down to dinner with Mrs. Trevor and her seven children,
when the Doctor came in.&nbsp; He was flurried and uncomfortable, and
hurried the children away as soon as he decently could.&nbsp; Then (rather
feeling Miss Galindo&rsquo;s presence an advantage, both as a present
restraint on the violence of his wife&rsquo;s grief, and as a consoler
when he was absent on his afternoon round), he told Mrs. Trevor of her
brother&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He had been taken ill on circuit, and had
hurried back to his chambers in London only to die.&nbsp; She cried
terribly; but Doctor Trevor said afterwards, he never noticed that Miss
Galindo cared much about it one way or another.&nbsp; She helped him
to soothe his wife, promised to stay with her all the afternoon instead
of returning to Hanbury, and afterwards offered to remain with her while
the Doctor went to attend the funeral.&nbsp; When they heard of the
old love-story between the dead man and Miss Galindo,&mdash;brought
up by mutual friends in Westmoreland, in the review which we are all
inclined to take of the events of a man&rsquo;s life when he comes to
die,&mdash;they tried to remember Miss Galindo&rsquo;s speeches and
ways of going on during this visit.&nbsp; She was a little pale, a little
silent; her eyes were sometimes swollen, and her nose red; but she was
at an age when such appearances are generally attributed to a bad cold
in the head, rather than to any more sentimental reason.&nbsp; They
felt towards her as towards an old friend, a kindly, useful, eccentric
old maid.&nbsp; She did not expect more, or wish them to remember that
she might once have had other hopes, and more youthful feelings.&nbsp;
Doctor Trevor thanked her very warmly for staying with his wife, when
he returned home from London (where the funeral had taken place).&nbsp;
He begged Miss Galindo to stay with them, when the children were gone
to bed, and she was preparing to leave the husband and wife by themselves.&nbsp;
He told her and his wife many particulars&mdash;then paused&mdash;then
went on&mdash;&ldquo;And Mark has left a child&mdash;a little girl&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he never was married!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Trevor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little girl,&rdquo; continued her husband, &ldquo;whose
mother, I conclude, is dead.&nbsp; At any rate, the child was in possession
of his chambers; she and an old nurse, who seemed to have the charge
of everything, and has cheated poor Mark, I should fancy, not a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the child!&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trevor, still almost breathless
with astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you know it is his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nurse told me it was, with great appearance of indignation
at my doubting it.&nbsp; I asked the little thing her name, and all
I could get was &lsquo;Bessy!&rsquo; and a cry of &lsquo;Me wants papa!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The nurse said the mother was dead, and she knew no more about it than
that Mr. Gibson had engaged her to take care of the little girl, calling
it his child.&nbsp; One or two of his lawyer friends, whom I met with
at the funeral, told me they were aware of the existence of the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done with her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Gibson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mark
has hardly left assets enough to pay his debts, and your father is not
inclined to come forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, as Doctor Trevor sat in his study, after his wife had
gone to bed, Miss Galindo knocked at his door.&nbsp; She and he had
a long conversation.&nbsp; The result was that he accompanied Miss Galindo
up to town the next day; that they took possession of the little Bessy,
and she was brought down, and placed at nurse at a farm in the country
near Warwick, Miss Galindo undertaking to pay one-half of the expense,
and to furnish her with clothes, and Dr. Trevor undertaking that the
remaining half should be furnished by the Gibson family, or by himself
in their default.</p>
<p>Miss Galindo was not fond of children; and I dare say she dreaded
taking this child to live with her for more reasons than one.&nbsp;
My Lady Ludlow could not endure any mention of illegitimate children.&nbsp;
It was a principle of hers that society ought to ignore them.&nbsp;
And I believe Miss Galindo had always agreed with her until now, when
the thing came home to her womanly heart.&nbsp; Still she shrank from
having this child of some strange woman under her roof.&nbsp; She went
over to see it from time to time; she worked at its clothes long after
every one thought she was in bed; and, when the time came for Bessy
to be sent to school, Miss Galindo laboured away more diligently than
ever, in order to pay the increased expense.&nbsp; For the Gibson family
had, at first, paid their part of the compact, but with unwillingness
and grudging hearts; then they had left it off altogether, and it fell
hard on Dr. Trevor with his twelve children; and, latterly, Miss Galindo
had taken upon herself almost all the burden.&nbsp; One can hardly live
and labour, and plan and make sacrifices, for any human creature, without
learning to love it.&nbsp; And Bessy loved Miss Galindo, too, for all
the poor girl&rsquo;s scanty pleasures came from her, and Miss Galindo
had always a kind word, and, latterly, many a kind caress, for Mark
Gibson&rsquo;s child; whereas, if she went to Dr. Trevor&rsquo;s for
her holiday, she was overlooked and neglected in that bustling family,
who seemed to think that if she had comfortable board and lodging under
their roof, it was enough.</p>
<p>I am sure, now, that Miss Galindo had often longed to have Bessy
to live with her; but, as long as she could pay for her being at school,
she did not like to take so bold a step as bringing her home, knowing
what the effect of the consequent explanation would be on my lady.&nbsp;
And as the girl was now more than seventeen, and past the age when young
ladies are usually kept at school, and as there was no great demand
for governesses in those days, and as Bessy had never been taught any
trade by which to earn her own living, why I don&rsquo;t exactly see
what could have been done but for Miss Galindo to bring her to her own
home in Hanbury.&nbsp; For, although the child had grown up lately,
in a kind of unexpected manner, into a young woman, Miss Galindo might
have kept her at school for a year longer, if she could have afforded
it; but this was impossible when she became Mr. Horner&rsquo;s clerk,
and relinquished all the payment of her repository work; and perhaps,
after all, she was not sorry to be compelled to take the step she was
longing for.&nbsp; At any rate, Bessy came to live with Miss Galindo,
in a very few weeks from the time when Captain James set Miss Galindo
free to superintend her own domestic economy again.</p>
<p>For a long time, I knew nothing about this new inhabitant of Hanbury.&nbsp;
My lady never mentioned her in any way.&nbsp; This was in accordance
with Lady Ludlow&rsquo;s well-known principles.&nbsp; She neither saw
nor heard, nor was in any way cognisant of the existence of those who
had no legal right to exist at all.&nbsp; If Miss Galindo had hoped
to have an exception made in Bessy&rsquo;s favour, she was mistaken.&nbsp;
My lady sent a note inviting Miss Galindo herself to tea one evening,
about a month after Bessy came; but Miss Galindo &ldquo;had a cold and
could not come.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next time she was invited, she &ldquo;had
an engagement at home&rdquo;&mdash;a step nearer to the absolute truth.&nbsp;
And the third time, she &ldquo;had a young friend staying with her whom
she was unable to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; My lady accepted every excuse
as bon&acirc; fide, and took no further notice.&nbsp; I missed Miss
Galindo very much; we all did; for, in the days when she was clerk,
she was sure to come in and find the opportunity of saying something
amusing to some of us before she went away.&nbsp; And I, as an invalid,
or perhaps from natural tendency, was particularly fond of little bits
of village gossip.&nbsp; There was no Mr. Horner&mdash;he even had come
in, now and then, with formal, stately pieces of intelligence&mdash;and
there was no Miss Galindo in these days.&nbsp; I missed her much.&nbsp;
And so did my lady, I am sure.&nbsp; Behind all her quiet, sedate manner,
I am certain her heart ached sometimes for a few words from Miss Galindo,
who seemed to have absented herself altogether from the Hall now Bessy
was come.</p>
<p>Captain James might be very sensible, and all that; but not even
my lady could call him a substitute for the old familiar friends.&nbsp;
He was a thorough sailor, as sailors were in those days&mdash;swore
a good deal, drank a good deal (without its ever affecting him in the
least), and was very prompt and kind-hearted in all his actions; but
he was not accustomed to women, as my lady once said, and would judge
in all things for himself.&nbsp; My lady had expected, I think, to find
some one who would take his notions on the management of her estate
from her ladyship&rsquo;s own self; but he spoke as if he were responsible
for the good management of the whole, and must, consequently, be allowed
full liberty of action.&nbsp; He had been too long in command over men
at sea to like to be directed by a woman in anything he undertook, even
though that woman was my lady.&nbsp; I suppose this was the common-sense
my lady spoke of; but when common-sense goes against us, I don&rsquo;t
think we value it quite so much as we ought to do.</p>
<p>Lady Ludlow was proud of her personal superintendence of her own
estate.&nbsp; She liked to tell us how her father used to take her with
him in his rides, and bid her observe this and that, and on no account
to allow such and such things to be done.&nbsp; But I have heard that
the first time she told all this to Captain James, he told her point-blank
that he had heard from Mr. Smithson that the farms were much neglected
and the rents sadly behind-hand, and that he meant to set to in good
earnest and study agriculture, and see how he could remedy the state
of things.&nbsp; My lady would, I am sure, be greatly surprised, but
what could she do?&nbsp; Here was the very man she had chosen herself,
setting to with all his energy to conquer the defect of ignorance, which
was all that those who had presumed to offer her ladyship advice had
ever had to say against him.&nbsp; Captain James read Arthur Young&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tours&rdquo; in all his spare time, as long as he was an invalid;
and shook his head at my lady&rsquo;s accounts as to how the land had
been cropped or left fallow from time immemorial.&nbsp; Then he set
to, and tried too many new experiments at once.&nbsp; My lady looked
on in dignified silence; but all the farmers and tenants were in an
uproar, and prophesied a hundred failures.&nbsp; Perhaps fifty did occur;
they were only half as many as Lady Ludlow had feared; but they were
twice as many, four, eight times as many as the captain had anticipated.&nbsp;
His openly-expressed disappointment made him popular again.&nbsp; The
rough country people could not have understood silent and dignified
regret at the failure of his plans, but they sympathized with a man
who swore at his ill success&mdash;sympathized, even while they chuckled
over his discomfiture.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke, the retired tradesman, did
not cease blaming him for not succeeding, and for swearing.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what could you expect from a sailor?&rdquo; Mr. Brooke asked, even in
my lady&rsquo;s hearing; though he might have known Captain James was
my lady&rsquo;s own personal choice, from the old friendship Mr. Urian
had always shown for him.&nbsp; I think it was this speech of the Birmingham
baker&rsquo;s that made my lady determine to stand by Captain James,
and encourage him to try again.&nbsp; For she would not allow that her
choice had been an unwise one, at the bidding (as it were) of a dissenting
tradesman; the only person in the neighbourhood, too, who had flaunted
about in coloured clothes, when all the world was in mourning for my
lady&rsquo;s only son.</p>
<p>Captain James would have thrown the agency up at once, if my lady
had not felt herself bound to justify the wisdom of her choice, by urging
him to stay.&nbsp; He was much touched by her confidence in him, and
swore a great oath, that the next year he would make the land such as
it had never been before for produce.&nbsp; It was not my lady&rsquo;s
way to repeat anything she had heard, especially to another person&rsquo;s
disadvantage.&nbsp; So I don&rsquo;t think she ever told Captain James
of Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s speech about a sailor&rsquo;s being likely to
mismanage the property; and the captain was too anxious to succeed in
this, the second year of his trial, to be above going to the flourishing,
shrewd Mr. Brooke, and asking for his advice as to the best method of
working the estate.&nbsp; I dare say, if Miss Galindo had been as intimate
as formerly at the Hall, we should all of us have heard of this new
acquaintance of the agent&rsquo;s long before we did.&nbsp; As it was,
I am sure my lady never dreamed that the captain, who held opinions
that were even more Church and King than her own, could ever have made
friends with a Baptist baker from Birmingham, even to serve her ladyship&rsquo;s
own interests in the most loyal manner.</p>
<p>We heard of it first from Mr. Gray, who came now often to see my
lady, for neither he nor she could forget the solemn tie which the fact
of his being the person to acquaint her with my lord&rsquo;s death had
created between them.&nbsp; For true and holy words spoken at that time,
though having no reference to aught below the solemn subjects of life
and death, had made her withdraw her opposition to Mr. Gray&rsquo;s
wish about establishing a village school.&nbsp; She had sighed a little,
it is true, and was even yet more apprehensive than hopeful as to the
result; but almost as if as a memorial to my lord, she had allowed a
kind of rough school-house to be built on the green, just by the church;
and had gently used the power she undoubtedly had, in expressing her
strong wish that the boys might only be taught to read and write, and
the first four rules of arithmetic; while the girls were only to learn
to read, and to add up in their heads, and the rest of the time to work
at mending their own clothes, knitting stockings and spinning.&nbsp;
My lady presented the school with more spinning-wheels than there were
girls, and requested that there might be a rule that they should have
spun so many hanks of flax, and knitted so many pairs of stockings,
before they ever were taught to read at all.&nbsp; After all, it was
but making the best of a bad job with my poor lady&mdash;but life was
not what it had been to her.&nbsp; I remember well the day that Mr.
Gray pulled some delicately fine yarn (and I was a good judge of those
things) out of his pocket, and laid it and a capital pair of knitted
stockings before my lady, as the first-fruits, so to say, of his school.&nbsp;
I recollect seeing her put on her spectacles, and carefully examine
both productions.&nbsp; Then she passed them to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is well, Mr. Gray.&nbsp; I am much pleased.&nbsp; You
are fortunate in your schoolmistress.&nbsp; She has had both proper
knowledge of womanly things and much patience.&nbsp; Who is she?&nbsp;
One out of our village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, stammering and colouring in
his old fashion, &ldquo;Miss Bessy is so very kind as to teach all those
sorts of things&mdash;Miss Bessy, and Miss Galindo, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady looked at him over her spectacles: but she only repeated
the words &ldquo;Miss Bessy,&rdquo; and paused, as if trying to remember
who such a person could be; and he, if he had then intended to say more,
was quelled by her manner, and dropped the subject.&nbsp; He went on
to say, that he had thought it his duty to decline the subscription to
his school offered by Mr. Brooke, because he was a Dissenter; that he
(Mr. Gray) feared that Captain James, through whom Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s
offer of money had been made, was offended at his refusing to accept
it from a man who held heterodox opinions; nay, whom Mr. Gray suspected
of being infected by Dodwell&rsquo;s heresy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there must be some mistake,&rdquo; said my lady, &ldquo;or
I have misunderstood you.&nbsp; Captain James would never be sufficiently
with a schismatic to be employed by that man Brooke in distributing
his charities.&nbsp; I should have doubted, until now, if Captain James
knew him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my lady, he not only knows him, but is intimate with
him, I regret to say.&nbsp; I have repeatedly seen the captain and Mr.
Brooke walking together; going through the fields together; and people
do say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady looked up in interrogation at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disapprove of gossip, and it may be untrue; but people do
say that Captain James is very attentive to Miss Brooke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said my lady, indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Captain
James is a loyal and religious man.&nbsp; I beg your pardon Mr. Gray,
but it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>Like many other things which have been declared to be impossible,
this report of Captain James being attentive to Miss Brooke turned out
to be very true.</p>
<p>The mere idea of her agent being on the slightest possible terms
of acquaintance with the Dissenter, the tradesman, the Birmingham democrat,
who had come to settle in our good, orthodox, aristocratic, and agricultural
Hanbury, made my lady very uneasy.&nbsp; Miss Galindo&rsquo;s misdemeanour
in having taken Miss Bessy to live with her, faded into a mistake, a
mere error of judgment, in comparison with Captain James&rsquo;s intimacy
at Yeast House, as the Brookes called their ugly square-built farm.&nbsp;
My lady talked herself quite into complacency with Miss Galindo, and
even Miss Bessy was named by her, the first time I had ever been aware
that my lady recognized her existence; but&mdash;I recollect it was
a long rainy afternoon, and I sat with her ladyship, and we had time
and opportunity for a long uninterrupted talk&mdash;whenever we had
been silent for a little while she began again, with something like
a wonder how it was that Captain James could ever have commenced an
acquaintance with &ldquo;that man Brooke.&rdquo;&nbsp; My lady recapitulated
all the times she could remember, that anything had occurred, or been
said by Captain James which she could now understand as throwing light
upon the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said once that he was anxious to bring in the Norfolk system
of cropping, and spoke a good deal about Mr. Coke of Holkham (who, by
the way, was no more a Coke than I am&mdash;collateral in the female
line&mdash;which counts for little or nothing among the great old commoners&rsquo;
families of pure blood), and his new ways of cultivation; of course
new men bring in new ways, but it does not follow that either are better
than the old ways.&nbsp; However, Captain James has been very anxious
to try turnips and bone manure, and he really is a man of such good
sense and energy, and was so sorry last year about the failure, that
I consented; and now I begin to see my error.&nbsp; I have always heard
that town bakers adulterate their flour with bone-dust; and, of course,
Captain James would be aware of this, and go to Brooke to inquire where
the article was to be purchased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady always ignored the fact which had sometimes, I suspect, been
brought under her very eyes during her drives, that Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s
few fields were in a state of far higher cultivation than her own; so
she could not, of course, perceive that there was any wisdom to be gained
from asking the advice of the tradesman turned farmer.</p>
<p>But by-and-by this fact of her agent&rsquo;s intimacy with the person
whom in the whole world she most disliked (with that sort of dislike
in which a large amount of uncomfortableness is combined&mdash;the dislike
which conscientious people sometimes feel to another without knowing
why, and yet which they cannot indulge in with comfort to themselves
without having a moral reason why), came before my lady in many shapes.&nbsp;
For, indeed I am sure that Captain James was not a man to conceal or
be ashamed of one of his actions.&nbsp; I cannot fancy his ever lowering
his strong loud clear voice, or having a confidental conversation with
any one.&nbsp; When his crops had failed, all the village had known
it.&nbsp; He complained, he regretted, he was angry, or owned himself
a --- fool, all down the village street; and the consequence was that,
although he was a far more passionate man than Mr. Horner, all the tenants
liked him far better.&nbsp; People, in general, take a kindlier interest
in any one, the workings of whose mind and heart they can watch and
understand, than in a man who only lets you know what he has been thinking
about and feeling, by what he does.&nbsp; But Harry Gregson was faithful
to the memory of Mr. Horner.&nbsp; Miss Galindo has told me that she
used to watch him hobble out of the way of Captain James, as if to accept
his notice, however good-naturedly given, would have been a kind of
treachery to his former benefactor.&nbsp; But Gregson (the father) and
the new agent rather took to each other; and one day, much to my surprise,
I heard that the &ldquo;poaching, tinkering vagabond,&rdquo; as the
people used to call Gregson when I first had come to live at Hanbury,
had been appointed gamekeeper; Mr. Gray standing godfather, as it were,
to his trustworthiness, if he were trusted with anything; which I thought
at the time was rather an experiment, only it answered, as many of Mr.
Gray&rsquo;s deeds of daring did.&nbsp; It was curious how he was growing
to be a kind of autocrat in the village; and how unconscious he was
of it.&nbsp; He was as shy and awkward and nervous as ever in any affair
that was not of some moral consequence to him.&nbsp; But as soon as
he was convinced that a thing was right, he &ldquo;shut his eyes and
ran and butted at it like a ram,&rdquo; as Captain James once expressed
it, in talking over something Mr. Gray had done.&nbsp; People in the
village said, &ldquo;they never knew what the parson would be at next;&rdquo;
or they might have said, &ldquo;where his reverence would next turn
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; For I have heard of his marching right into the middle
of a set of poachers, gathered together for some desperate midnight
enterprise, or walking into a public-house that lay just beyond the
bounds of my lady&rsquo;s estate, and in that extra-parochial piece
of ground I named long ago, and which was considered the rendezvous
of all the ne&rsquo;er-do-weel characters for miles round, and where
a parson and a constable were held in much the same kind of esteem as
unwelcome visitors.&nbsp; And yet Mr. Gray had his long fits of depression,
in which he felt as if he were doing nothing, making no way in his work,
useless and unprofitable, and better out of the world than in it.&nbsp;
In comparison with the work he had set himself to do, what he did seemed
to be nothing.&nbsp; I suppose it was constitutional, those attacks
of lowness of spirits which he had about this time; perhaps a part of
the nervousness which made him always so awkward when he came to the
Hall.&nbsp; Even Mrs. Medlicott, who almost worshipped the ground he
trod on, as the saying is, owned that Mr. Gray never entered one of
my lady&rsquo;s rooms without knocking down something, and too often
breaking it.&nbsp; He would much sooner have faced a desperate poacher
than a young lady any day.&nbsp; At least so we thought.</p>
<p>I do not know how it was that it came to pass that my lady became
reconciled to Miss Galindo about this time.&nbsp; Whether it was that
her ladyship was weary of the unspoken coolness with her old friend;
or that the specimens of delicate sewing and fine spinning at the school
had mollified her towards Miss Bessy; but I was surprised to learn one
day that Miss Galindo and her young friend were coming that very evening
to tea at the Hall.&nbsp; This information was given me by Mrs. Medlicott,
as a message from my lady, who further went on to desire that certain
little preparations should be made in her own private sitting-room,
in which the greater part of my days were spent.&nbsp; From the nature
of these preparations, I became quite aware that my lady intended to
do honour to her expected visitors.&nbsp; Indeed, Lady Ludlow never
forgave by halves, as I have known some people do.&nbsp; Whoever was
coming as a visitor to my lady, peeress, or poor nameless girl, there
was a certain amount of preparation required in order to do them fitting
honour.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that the preparation was of the same
degree of importance in each case.&nbsp; I dare say, if a peeress had
come to visit us at the Hall, the covers would have been taken off the
furniture in the white drawing-room (they never were uncovered all the
time I stayed at the Hall), because my lady would wish to offer her
the ornaments and luxuries which this grand visitor (who never came&mdash;I
wish she had!&nbsp; I did so want to see that furniture uncovered!)
was accustomed to at home, and to present them to her in the best order
in which my lady could.&nbsp; The same rule, mollified, held good with
Miss Galindo.&nbsp; Certain things, in which my lady knew she took an
interest, were laid out ready for her to examine on this very day; and,
what was more, great books of prints were laid out, such as I remembered
my lady had had brought forth to beguile my own early days of illness,&mdash;Mr.
Hogarth&rsquo;s works, and the like,&mdash;which I was sure were put
out for Miss Bessy.</p>
<p>No one knows how curious I was to see this mysterious Miss Bessy&mdash;twenty
times more mysterious, of course, for want of her surname.&nbsp; And
then again (to try and account for my great curiosity, of which in recollection
I am more than half ashamed), I had been leading the quiet monotonous
life of a crippled invalid for many years,&mdash;shut up from any sight
of new faces; and this was to be the face of one whom I had thought
about so much and so long,&mdash;Oh!&nbsp; I think I might be excused.</p>
<p>Of course they drank tea in the great hall, with the four young gentlewomen,
who, with myself, formed the small bevy now under her ladyship&rsquo;s
charge.&nbsp; Of those who were at Hanbury when first I came, none remained;
all were married, or gone once more to live at some home which could
be called their own, whether the ostensible head were father or brother.&nbsp;
I myself was not without some hopes of a similar kind.&nbsp; My brother
Harry was now a curate in Westmoreland, and wanted me to go and live
with him, as eventually I did for a time.&nbsp; But that is neither
here nor there at present.&nbsp; What I am talking about is Miss Bessy.</p>
<p>After a reasonable time had elapsed, occupied as I well knew by the
meal in the great hall,&mdash;the measured, yet agreeable conversation
afterwards,&mdash;and a certain promenade around the hall, and through
the drawing-rooms, with pauses before different pictures, the history
or subject of each of which was invariably told by my lady to every
new visitor,&mdash;a sort of giving them the freedom of the old family-seat,
by describing the kind and nature of the great progenitors who had lived
there before the narrator,&mdash;I heard the steps approaching my lady&rsquo;s
room, where I lay.&nbsp; I think I was in such a state of nervous expectation,
that if I could have moved easily, I should have got up and run away.&nbsp;
And yet I need not have been, for Miss Galindo was not in the least
altered (her nose a little redder, to be sure, but then that might only
have had a temporary cause in the private crying I know she would have
had before coming to see her dear Lady Ludlow once again).&nbsp; But
I could almost have pushed Miss Galindo away, as she intercepted me
in my view of the mysterious Miss Bessy.</p>
<p>Miss Bessy was, as I knew, only about eighteen, but she looked older.&nbsp;
Dark hair, dark eyes, a tall, firm figure, a good, sensible face, with
a serene expression, not in the least disturbed by what I had been thinking
must be such awful circumstances as a first introduction to my lady,
who had so disapproved of her very existence: those are the clearest
impressions I remember of my first interview with Miss Bessy.&nbsp;
She seemed to observe us all, in her quiet manner, quite as much as
I did her; but she spoke very little; occupied herself, indeed, as my
lady had planned, with looking over the great books of engravings.&nbsp;
I think I must have (foolishly) intended to make her feel at her ease,
by my patronage; but she was seated far away from my sofa, in order
to command the light, and really seemed so unconcerned at her unwonted
circumstances, that she did not need my countenance or kindness.&nbsp;
One thing I did like&mdash;her watchful look at Miss Galindo from time
to time: it showed that her thoughts and sympathy were ever at Miss
Galindo&rsquo;s service, as indeed they well might be.&nbsp; When Miss
Bessy spoke, her voice was full and clear, and what she said, to the
purpose, though there was a slight provincial accent in her way of speaking.&nbsp;
After a while, my lady set us two to play at chess, a game which I had
lately learnt at Mr. Gray&rsquo;s suggestion.&nbsp; Still we did not
talk much together, though we were becoming attracted towards each other,
I fancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will play well,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
only learnt about six months, have you?&nbsp; And yet you can nearly
beat me, who have been at it as many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began to learn last November.&nbsp; I remember Mr. Gray&rsquo;s
bringing me &lsquo;Philidor on Chess,&rsquo; one very foggy, dismal
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What made her look up so suddenly, with bright inquiry in her eyes?&nbsp;
What made her silent for a moment as if in thought, and then go on with
something, I know not what, in quite an altered tone?</p>
<p>My lady and Miss Galindo went on talking, while I sat thinking.&nbsp;
I heard Captain James&rsquo;s name mentioned pretty frequently; and
at last my lady put down her work, and said, almost with tears in her
eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not&mdash;I cannot believe it.&nbsp; He must be aware
she is a schismatic; a baker&rsquo;s daughter; and he is a gentleman
by virtue and feeling, as well as by his profession, though his manners
may be at times a little rough.&nbsp; My dear Miss Galindo, what will
this world come to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Galindo might possibly be aware of her own share in bringing
the world to the pass which now dismayed my lady,&mdash;for of course,
though all was now over and forgiven, yet Miss, Bessy&rsquo;s being
received into a respectable maiden lady&rsquo;s house, was one of the
portents as to the world&rsquo;s future which alarmed her ladyship;
and Miss Galindo knew this,&mdash;but, at any rate, she had too lately
been forgiven herself not to plead for mercy for the next offender against
my lady&rsquo;s delicate sense of fitness and propriety,&mdash;so she
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my lady, I have long left off trying to conjecture
what makes Jack fancy Gill, or Gill Jack.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s best to sit
down quiet under the belief that marriages are made for us, somewhere
out of this world, and out of the range of this world&rsquo;s reason
and laws.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so sure that I should settle it down that
they were made in heaven; t&rsquo;other place seems to me as likely
a workshop; but at any rate, I&rsquo;ve given up troubling my head as
to why they take place.&nbsp; Captain James is a gentleman; I make no
doubt of that ever since I saw him stop to pick up old Goody Blake (when
she tumbled down on the slide last winter) and then swear at a little
lad who was laughing at her, and cuff him till he tumbled down crying;
but we must have bread somehow, and though I like it better baked at
home in a good sweet brick oven, yet, as some folks never can get it
to rise, I don&rsquo;t see why a man may not be a baker.&nbsp; You see,
my lady, I look upon baking as a simple trade, and as such lawful.&nbsp;
There is no machine comes in to take away a man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s
power of earning their living, like the spinning-jenny (the old busybody
that she is), to knock up all our good old women&rsquo;s livelihood,
and send them to their graves before their time.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
an invention of the enemy, if you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true!&rdquo; said my lady, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But baking bread is wholesome, straight-forward elbow-work.&nbsp;
They have not got to inventing any contrivance for that yet, thank Heaven!&nbsp;
It does not seem to me natural, nor according to Scripture, that iron
and steel (whose brows can&rsquo;t sweat) should be made to do man&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; And so I say, all those trades where iron and steel do the
work ordained to man at the Fall, are unlawful, and I never stand up
for them.&nbsp; But say this baker Brooke did knead his bread, and make
it rise, and then that people, who had, perhaps, no good ovens, came
to him, and bought his good light bread, and in this manner he turned
an honest penny and got rich; why, all I say, my lady, is this,&mdash;I
dare say he would have been born a Hanbury, or a lord if he could; and
if he was not, it is no fault of his, that I can see, that he made good
bread (being a baker by trade), and got money, and bought his land.&nbsp;
It was his misfortune, not his fault, that he was not a person of quality
by birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; said my lady, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause for consideration.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, although he was a baker,
he might have been a Churchman.&nbsp; Even your eloquence, Miss Galindo,
shan&rsquo;t convince me that that is not his own fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see even that, begging your pardon, my lady,&rdquo;
said Miss Galindo, emboldened by the first success of her eloquence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When a Baptist is a baby, if I understand their creed aright,
he is not baptized; and, consequently, he can have no godfathers and
godmothers to do anything for him in his baptism; you agree to that,
my lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady would rather have known what her acquiescence would lead
to, before acknowledging that she could not dissent from this first
proposition; still she gave her tacit agreement by bowing her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, you know, our godfathers and godmothers are expected
to promise and vow three things in our name, when we are little babies,
and can do nothing but squall for ourselves.&nbsp; It is a great privilege,
but don&rsquo;t let us be hard upon those who have not had the chance
of godfathers and godmothers.&nbsp; Some people, we know, are born with
silver spoons,&mdash;that&rsquo;s to say, a godfather to give one things,
and teach one&rsquo;s catechism, and see that we&rsquo;re confirmed
into good church-going Christians,&mdash;and others with wooden ladles
in their mouths.&nbsp; These poor last folks must just be content to
be godfatherless orphans, and Dissenters, all their lives; and if they
are tradespeople into the bargain, so much the worse for them; but let
us be humble Christians, my dear lady, and not hold our heads too high
because we were born orthodox quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on too fast, Miss Galindo!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t follow
you.&nbsp; Besides, I do believe dissent to be an invention of the Devil&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Why can&rsquo;t they believe as we do?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very wrong.&nbsp;
Besides, its schism and heresy, and, you know, the Bible says that&rsquo;s
as bad as witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady was not convinced, as I could see.&nbsp; After Miss Galindo
had gone, she sent Mrs. Medlicott for certain books out of the great
old library up stairs, and had them made up into a parcel under her
own eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Captain James comes to-morrow, I will speak to him about
these Brookes.&nbsp; I have not hitherto liked to speak to him, because
I did not wish to hurt him, by supposing there could be any truth in
the reports about his intimacy with them.&nbsp; But now I will try and
do my duty by him and them.&nbsp; Surely this great body of divinity
will bring them back to the true church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not tell, for though my lady read me over the titles, I was
not any the wiser as to their contents.&nbsp; Besides, I was much more
anxious to consult my lady as to my own change of place.&nbsp; I showed
her the letter I had that day received from Harry; and we once more
talked over the expediency of my going to live with him, and trying
what entire change of air would do to re-establish my failing health.&nbsp;
I could say anything to my lady, she was so sure to understand me rightly.&nbsp;
For one thing, she never thought of herself, so I had no fear of hurting
her by stating the truth.&nbsp; I told her how happy my years had been
while passed under her roof; but that now I had begun to wonder whether
I had not duties elsewhere, in making a home for Harry,&mdash;and whether
the fulfilment of these duties, quiet ones they must needs be in the
case of such a cripple as myself, would not prevent my sinking into
the querulous habit of thinking and talking, into which I found myself
occasionally falling.&nbsp; Add to which, there was the prospect of
benefit from the more bracing air of the north.</p>
<p>It was then settled that my departure from Hanbury, my happy home
for so long, was to take place before many weeks had passed.&nbsp; And
as, when one period of life is about to be shut up for ever, we are
sure to look back upon it with fond regret, so I, happy enough in my
future prospects, could not avoid recurring to all the days of my life
in the Hall, from the time when I came to it, a shy awkward girl, scarcely
past childhood, to now, when a grown woman,&mdash;past childhood&mdash;almost,
from the very character of my illness, past youth,&mdash;I was looking
forward to leaving my lady&rsquo;s house (as a residence) for ever.&nbsp;
As it has turned out, I never saw either her or it again.&nbsp; Like
a piece of sea-wreck, I have drifted away from those days: quiet, happy,
eventless days,&mdash;very happy to remember!</p>
<p>I thought of good, jovial Mr. Mountford,&mdash;and his regrets that
he might not keep a pack, &ldquo;a very small pack,&rdquo; of harriers,
and his merry ways, and his love of good eating; of the first coming
of Mr. Gray, and my lady&rsquo;s attempt to quench his sermons, when
they tended to enforce any duty connected with education.&nbsp; And
now we had an absolute school-house in the village; and since Miss Bessy&rsquo;s
drinking tea at the Hall, my lady had been twice inside it, to give
directions about some fine yarn she was having spun for table-napery.&nbsp;
And her ladyship had so outgrown her old custom of dispensing with sermon
or discourse, that even during the temporary preaching of Mr. Crosse,
she had never had recourse to it, though I believe she would have had
all the congregation on her side if she had.</p>
<p>And Mr. Horner was dead, and Captain James reigned in his stead.&nbsp;
Good, steady, severe, silent Mr. Horner! with his clock-like regularity,
and his snuff-coloured clothes, and silver buckles!&nbsp; I have often
wondered which one misses most when they are dead and gone,&mdash;the
bright creatures full of life, who are hither and thither and everywhere,
so that no one can reckon upon their coming and going, with whom stillness
and the long quiet of the grave, seems utterly irreconcilable, so full
are they of vivid motion and passion,&mdash;or the slow, serious people,
whose movements&mdash;nay, whose very words, seem to go by clockwork;
who never appear much to affect the course of our life while they are
with us, but whose methodical ways show themselves, when they are gone,
to have been intertwined with our very roots of daily existence.&nbsp;
I think I miss these last the most, although I may have loved the former
best.&nbsp; Captain James never was to me what Mr. Horner was, though
the latter had hardly changed a dozen words with me at the day of his
death.&nbsp; Then Miss Galindo!&nbsp; I remembered the time as if it
had been only yesterday, when she was but a name&mdash;and a very odd
one&mdash;to me; then she was a queer, abrupt, disagreeable, busy old
maid.&nbsp; Now I loved her dearly, and I found out that I was almost
jealous of Miss Bessy.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray I never thought of with love; the feeling was almost reverence
with which I looked upon him.&nbsp; I have not wished to speak much
of myself, or else I could have told you how much he had been to me
during these long, weary years of illness.&nbsp; But he was almost as
much to every one, rich and poor, from my lady down to Miss Galindo&rsquo;s
Sally.</p>
<p>The village, too, had a different look about it.&nbsp; I am sure
I could not tell you what caused the change; but there were no more
lounging young men to form a group at the cross-road, at a time of day
when young men ought to be at work.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say this was
all Mr. Gray&rsquo;s doing, for there really was so much to do in the
fields that there was but little time for lounging now-a-days.&nbsp;
And the children were hushed up in school, and better behaved out of
it, too, than in the days when I used to be able to go my lady&rsquo;s
errands in the village.&nbsp; I went so little about now, that I am
sure I can&rsquo;t tell who Miss Galindo found to scold; and yet she
looked so well and so happy that I think she must have had her accustomed
portion of that wholesome exercise.</p>
<p>Before I left Hanbury, the rumour that Captain James was going to
marry Miss Brooke, Baker Brooke&rsquo;s eldest daughter, who had only
a sister to share his property with her, was confirmed.&nbsp; He himself
announced it to my lady; nay, more, with a courage, gained, I suppose,
in his former profession, where, as I have heard, he had led his ship
into many a post of danger, he asked her ladyship, the Countess Ludlow,
if he might bring his bride elect, (the Baptist baker&rsquo;s daughter!)
and present her to my lady!</p>
<p>I am glad I was not present when he made this request; I should have
felt so much ashamed for him, and I could not have helped being anxious
till I heard my lady&rsquo;s answer, if I had been there.&nbsp; Of course
she acceded; but I can fancy the grave surprise of her look.&nbsp; I
wonder if Captain James noticed it.</p>
<p>I hardly dared ask my lady, after the interview had taken place,
what she thought of the bride elect; but I hinted my curiosity, and
she told me, that if the young person had applied to Mrs. Medlicott,
for the situation of cook, and Mrs. Medlicott had engaged her, she thought
that it would have been a very suitable arrangement.&nbsp; I understood
from this how little she thought a marriage with Captain James, R.N.,
suitable.</p>
<p>About a year after I left Hanbury, I received a letter from Miss
Galindo; I think I can find it.&mdash;Yes, this is it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Hanbury, May 4, 1811.</p>
<p>DEAR MARGARET,</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask for news of us all.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know there
is no news in Hanbury?&nbsp; Did you ever hear of an event here?&nbsp;
Now, if you have answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in your own mind to these
questions, you have fallen into my trap, and never were more mistaken
in your life.&nbsp; Hanbury is full of news; and we have more events
on our hands than we know what to do with.&nbsp; I will take them in
the order of the newspapers&mdash;births, deaths, and marriages.&nbsp;
In the matter of births, Jenny Lucas has had twins not a week ago.&nbsp;
Sadly too much of a good thing, you&rsquo;ll say.&nbsp; Very true: but
then they died; so their birth did not much signify.&nbsp; My cat has
kittened, too; she has had three kittens, which again you may observe
is too much of a good thing; and so it would be, if it were not for
the next item of intelligence I shall lay before you.&nbsp; Captain
and Mrs. James have taken the old house next Pearson&rsquo;s; and the
house is overrun with mice, which is just as fortunate for me as the
King of Egypt&rsquo;s rat-ridden kingdom was to Dick Whittington.&nbsp;
For my cat&rsquo;s kittening decided me to go and call on the bride,
in hopes she wanted a cat; which she did like a sensible woman, as I
do believe she is, in spite of Baptism, Bakers, Bread, and Birmingham,
and something worse than all, which you shall hear about, if you&rsquo;ll
only be patient.&nbsp; As I had got my best bonnet on, the one I bought
when poor Lord Ludlow was last at Hanbury in &rsquo;99&mdash;I thought
it a great condescension in myself (always remembering the date of the
Galindo baronetcy) to go and call on the bride; though I don&rsquo;t
think so much of myself in my every-day clothes, as you know.&nbsp;
But who should I find there but my Lady Ludlow!&nbsp; She looks as frail
and delicate as ever, but is, I think, in better heart ever since that
old city merchant of a Hanbury took it into his head that he was a cadet
of the Hanburys of Hanbury, and left her that handsome legacy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll warrant you that the mortgage was paid off pretty fast; and
Mr. Horner&rsquo;s money&mdash;or my lady&rsquo;s money, or Harry Gregson&rsquo;s
money, call it which you will&mdash;is invested in his name, all right
and tight; and they do talk of his being captain of his school, or Grecian,
or something, and going to college, after all!&nbsp; Harry Gregson the
poacher&rsquo;s son!&nbsp; Well! to be sure, we are living in strange
times!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I have not done with the marriages yet.&nbsp; Captain
James&rsquo;s is all very well, but no one cares for it now, we are
so full of Mr. Gray&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, Mr. Gray is going to
be married, and to nobody else but my little Bessy!&nbsp; I tell her
she will have to nurse him half the days of her life, he is such a frail
little body.&nbsp; But she says she does not care for that; so that
his body holds his soul, it is enough for her.&nbsp; She has a good
spirit and a brave heart, has my Bessy!&nbsp; It is a great advantage
that she won&rsquo;t have to mark her clothes over again: for when she
had knitted herself her last set of stockings, I told her to put G for
Galindo, if she did not choose to put it for Gibson, for she should
be my child if she was no one else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And now you see it
stands for Gray.&nbsp; So there are two marriages, and what more would
you have?&nbsp; And she promises to take another of my kittens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, as to deaths, old Farmer Hale is dead&mdash;poor old
man, I should think his wife thought it a good riddance, for he beat
her every day that he was drunk, and he was never sober, in spite of
Mr. Gray.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think (as I tell him) that Mr. Gray would
ever have found courage to speak to Bessy as long as Farmer Hale lived,
he took the old gentleman&rsquo;s sins so much to heart, and seemed
to think it was all his fault for not being able to make a sinner into
a saint.&nbsp; The parish bull is dead too.&nbsp; I never was so glad
in my life.&nbsp; But they say we are to have a new one in his place.&nbsp;
In the meantime I cross the common in peace, which is very convenient
just now, when I have so often to go to Mr. Gray&rsquo;s to see about
furnishing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you think I have told you all the Hanbury news, don&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; The very greatest thing of all is to come.&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t tantalize you, but just out with it, for you would never
guess it.&nbsp; My Lady Ludlow has given a party, just like any plebeian
amongst us.&nbsp; We had tea and toast in the blue drawing-room, old
John Footman waiting with Tom Diggles, the lad that used to frighten
away crows in Farmer Hale&rsquo;s fields, following in my lady&rsquo;s
livery, hair powdered and everything.&nbsp; Mrs. Medlicott made tea
in my lady&rsquo;s own room.&nbsp; My lady looked like a splendid fairy
queen of mature age, in black velvet, and the old lace, which I have
never seen her wear before since my lord&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; But the
company? you&rsquo;ll say.&nbsp; Why, we had the parson of Clover, and
the parson of Headleigh, and the parson of Merribank, and the three
parsonesses; and Farmer Donkin, and two Miss Donkins; and Mr. Gray (of
course), and myself and Bessy; and Captain and Mrs. James; yes, and
Mr. and Mrs. Brooke; think of that!&nbsp; I am not sure the parsons
liked it; but he was there.&nbsp; For he has been helping Captain James
to get my lady&rsquo;s land into order; and then his daughter married
the agent; and Mr. Gray (who ought to know) says that, after all, Baptists
are not such bad people; and he was right against them at one time,
as you may remember.&nbsp; Mrs. Brooke is a rough diamond, to be sure.&nbsp;
People have said that of me, I know.&nbsp; But, being a Galindo, I learnt
manners in my youth and can take them up when I choose.&nbsp; But Mrs.
Brooke never learnt manners, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&nbsp; When John Footman
handed her the tray with the tea-cups, she looked up at him as if she
were sorely puzzled by that way of going on.&nbsp; I was sitting next
to her, so I pretended not to see her perplexity, and put her cream
and sugar in for her, and was all ready to pop it into her hands,&mdash;when
who should come up, but that impudent lad Tom Diggles (I call him lad,
for all his hair is powdered, for you know that it is not natural gray
hair), with his tray full of cakes and what not, all as good as Mrs.
Medlicott could make them.&nbsp; By this time, I should tell you, all
the parsonesses were looking at Mrs. Brooke, for she had shown her want
of breeding before; and the parsonesses, who were just a step above
her in manners, were very much inclined to smile at her doings and sayings.&nbsp;
Well! what does she do, but pull out a clean Bandanna pocket-handkerchief
all red and yellow silk, spread it over her best silk gown; it was,
like enough, a new one, for I had it from Sally, who had it from her
cousin Molly, who is dairy-woman at the Brookes&rsquo;, that the Brookes
were mighty set-up with an invitation to drink tea at the Hall.&nbsp;
There we were, Tom Diggles even on the grin (I wonder how long it is
since he was own brother to a scarecrow, only not so decently dressed)
and Mrs. Parsoness of Headleigh,&mdash;I forget her name, and it&rsquo;s
no matter, for she&rsquo;s an ill-bred creature, I hope Bessy will behave
herself better&mdash;was right-down bursting with laughter, and as near
a hee-haw as ever a donkey was, when what does my lady do?&nbsp; Ay!
there&rsquo;s my own dear Lady Ludlow, God bless her!&nbsp; She takes
out her own pocket-handkerchief, all snowy cambric, and lays it softly
down on her velvet lap, for all the world as if she did it every day
of her life, just like Mrs. Brooke, the baker&rsquo;s wife; and when
the one got up to shake the crumbs into the fire-place, the other did
just the same.&nbsp; But with such a grace! and such a look at us all!&nbsp;
Tom Diggles went red all over; and Mrs. Parsoness of Headleigh scarce
spoke for the rest of the evening; and the tears came into my old silly
eyes; and Mr. Gray, who was before silent and awkward in a way which
I tell Bessy she must cure him of, was made so happy by this pretty
action of my lady&rsquo;s, that he talked away all the rest of the evening,
and was the life of the company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Margaret Dawson!&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if you&rsquo;re
the better off for leaving us.&nbsp; To be sure you&rsquo;re with your
brother, and blood is blood.&nbsp; But when I look at my lady and Mr.
Gray, for all they&rsquo;re so different, I would not change places
with any in England.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas! alas!&nbsp; I never saw my dear lady again.&nbsp; She died
in eighteen hundred and fourteen, and Mr. Gray did not long survive
her.&nbsp; As I dare say you know, the Reverend Henry Gregson is now
vicar of Hanbury, and his wife is the daughter of Mr. Gray and Miss
Bessy.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
